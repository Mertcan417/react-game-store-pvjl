It’s the racing game where racing is for wimps.<br><br>Now the same Mac &amp; PC classic that was BANNED AROUND THE WORLD is back!<br><br>Carmageddon features real-world environments that have been turned into killing fields, where the locals stay out on the streets at their peril. As well as using your car as a weapon, every level is sprinkled generously with power-ups that have a vast variety of mad effects, adding a whole extra level of craziness to the proceedings. In every event you have the option to “play it your way”… Waste all your opponents, kill every pedestrian, or (perish the thought) complete all the laps.

        "description": "Recently updated with This War of Mine: Final Cut!<br>This War of Mine: Final Cut is the conclusive, remastered edition of the game that contains all the updates and free expansions released so far and introduces not only a new scenario but also expands all scenarios with the locations known from Stories DLCs - even if you don’t own those. In short words - that means you can now experience lots of never-seen-before playthroughs and struggle with new challenges.ABOUT THIS WAR OF MINE:<br><br>In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.<br><br>The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive.<br><br>Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.<br><br>This War of Mine - main features:<ul><li>Inspired by real-life events<br></li><li>Control your survivors and manage your shelter<br></li><li>Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive<br></li><li>Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience<br></li><li>Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game<br></li><li>Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme</li></ul><br>The universe of This War of Mine has been expanded by following DLCs:<ul><li><strong>The Little Ones</strong> - explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective - that of a child.<br></li><li><strong>This War of Mine: Anniversary Edition </strong>- this free DLC, created especially for the 2nd Anniversary of the game, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same – how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about?<br></li><li><strong>This War of Mine: Stories DLCs:</strong><ul><li><strong>Episode 1: The Father's Promise</strong> –  a heartbreaking tale of loss and hope in a war-torn city<br></li><li><strong>Episode 2: The Last Broadcast </strong>– where, as a radio operator, you are going to face moral dilemmas and decide, whether there is a price too high for the truth<br></li><li><strong>Episode 3: Fading Embers</strong> – portrays a story of Anja living in a warzone and carrying a heavy burden as she has to answer to herself what is more important - survival of human legacy or the survival of a man…</li></ul></li></ul>",

        "description": "Paper Dungeons is a fantasy board-game boosted by online content. With the ability to create and share online your own levels, you are up for an infinite replay value! The game is visualized as a classic tabletop board-game with dice and tokens. You can destroy walls and auto-heal as you uncover new dungeon tiles, which widens your choice of moves.Game Modes<br>Paper Dungeons features 4 SINGLE PLAYER MODES, each with a different gameplay: <br><br><ul><li><strong>Boardgame mode:</strong><br>Begin every dungeon as a new board from a long adventure set: each new dungeon, your character resets to level 1 fortunately you keep your inventory. Unexplored parts of the dungeons are hidden by a fog of war. Monsters and items are placed at random, combats based on your statistics and dice rolls. Mitigate the combat’s result with a 2d6 (one for damages and the other for effects). Favor one attribute when you level up. Unlock and collect sets of dice (common/uncommon/rare/epic), but Beware! Monsters use their own too. An awareness system makes the monsters move towards you if you are in their line of sight. Dig up the walls to flee, at the cost of some precious health...   <br></li><li><strong>Campaign mode:</strong><br>This new mode allows you to play a fully-fledged adventure with up to 10 dungeons linked together by an introduction, dialogs between dungeons and a conclusion. Your character doesn't reset and keeps his inventory between dungeons.<br></li><li><strong>Rogue mode:</strong><br>Your character doesn't reset at each new dungeon and keeps leveling up until you meet your demise. What will remain is your name in the Hall of Fame and more powerful sets of dice that you can use in your next Rogue run.<br></li><li><strong>Puzzle mode:</strong><br>Hard-core campaign levels with no place for luck. No fog of war: the dungeon's layout (mobs and items) is shown. Monsters are static and won't move towards you. Strategize all your moves to ensure victory.</li></ul>Also availables:<ul><li>A MAP EDITOR, to create your own dungeons and publish them online.<br></li><li>A CAMPAIGN EDITOR, to tell your own story and post it online.<br></li><li>ONLINE LEVELS feature, to play user's created content in Adventure or Puzzle modes.<br></li><li>A CODEX listing all elements of the game.<br></li><li>An hardcore difficulty THE VOID with alternate color for the monsters.</li></ul>Features<ul><li>Supports high resolution with native 1080p graphics.<br></li><li>Big adventure of 125 Boardgame levels and 31 Puzzle levels.<br></li><li>5 character classes (warrior/archer/priest/mage/thief), male and female, each with a unique gameplay.<br></li><li>2 Official campaigns.<br></li><li>Dozens of different dice sets to improve your character.<br></li><li>80+ monster types.<br></li><li>More than 50 unique pieces of equipement, 30 scrolls and 8 potions.<br></li><li>4 different starting zones, each with specific monsters and bosses, 3 sizes of dungeon and special boss stages.<br></li><li>5 zoom levels.</li></ul>",

Donning the bodies of mortal vassals, they could live in the realms of man forever. The great hero and warlock Harbinger was the only one who could stand up to their power.

There, your destiny draws you into the path that Harbinger trod - to confront the Revenants and banish their souls back to the Well forever. Your travels will take you far from Madrigal, to the ruined kingdoms of Horath, the ancient empire of Thardolin, and through the lost city of Talendrah. You will brave searing deserts and icy plains. You will have to seek answers among the living and the dead.<br><br><ul><li>Customizable combat and magic system that can be as simple or as complex as you like.<br></li><li>Compelling story with many twists and turns will keep you hooked for hours.<br></li><li>Dynamic music, high quality voice acting, and more than one possible ending.</li></ul>",

        "description": "Volume 2: &quot;U7 - Berlin&quot; is the next release continuing the successful product series &quot; World of Subways&quot; introducing famous subway lines around the world to all subway enthusiasts. After Vol. 1, Vol. 2 contains the route U7 of Berlin`s subway. It takes you from Spandau to Rudow and is therefore the longest of all Berlin`s subway routes.Route map<br>With a coverage of 31.8 km (19,8 miles) and 40 stations the U7 is not only the longest of all Berlin subway lines but also the line with the most stations and the longest journey time. Built from 1924 to 1984 this large profile line runs completely underground, through a total of 5 districts of the German capital and even goes underneath the rivers Spree and Havel as well as the Teltow and the Westhafen canal. More of its history can be found <a>here</a><br><br>Features<br>Here´s what you can expect from &quot;World of Subways Vol. 2: U7 - Berlin &quot; A feature list to be exited about.<br><br><ul><li>Animated display monitors at stations.<br></li><li>Realistic shift service to schedule.<br></li><li>Intelligent and custom announcements<br></li><li>Passenger volume dependend on time if day.<br></li><li>Simulation of wear and tear caused by style of operation (can be selected via options)<br></li><li>Extensive scoring system, adding to the excitement and fun.<br></li><li>Custom setting of destination display during operations.<br></li><li>Customizable light settings on train (position lights, cab lighting, etc)<br></li><li>Opening doors to be seen from either inside or outside, controlled by the player<br></li><li>Doors can be openend seperately. Options are the doors on the right and left side of the train. Of course you can also open both sides at the same time.<br></li><li>Train vibration – as soon as the train starts moving, vibrations will take effect on the train.<br></li><li>Train swings – The train will start swinging the higher the speed. You will especially get this kind of feel in the cab. Hard braking will also produce this effect and the train will still be in a swinging motion when it has come to a full stop.<br></li><li>Intelligent AI traffic operating to real schedules. Display on destination signs and announcements are controlled automatically.<br></li><li>Configurable key commands – The player can freely configure keys to his liking. He can for instance configure the key for the brake lever wherever he wants.<br></li><li>3D – Cockpit with rotatable camera – allowing the player to look around. By using a key stroke the view angle will be centered again.<br></li><li>Free movement inside the train – While the train is stationary at a station you will have the option to switch to an ego perspective inside the passenger car. You can move by using keyboard commands, view angles can be controlled with the mouse.<br></li><li>Free movement on the station – you can get off the train at any station and move around (ego perspective). There will also be some missions starting on the platform of a station. The player will have to walk into to the train, into the cab which is seperated from the passenger area by a door.<br></li><li>Free movement in the tunnels and on the track<br></li><li>Changing of cabs – sometimes you will have to change the cabs during a mission. The train driver has to leave the cab, the train and then walk along the platform to the other end. He then gets into the train and cab again to prepare for departure.<br></li><li>A brandnew mission module with new mission<br></li><li>Flashlight for virtual walk in the tunnel<br></li><li>Compatible with Raildriver Cab Controller</li></ul>Rolling Stock<br>The U-7 line is a so called wide gauge line, carrying only wide gauge trains. The main difference to the narrow gauge line trains such as the U1, U2, U15, U3 and U4 line trains lies in the measurements of the carriages and the power supply. Gauge width though is the same on the narrow and wide gauge tracks (1435 millimeters).&quot;World of Subways Vol.2: U7 - Berlin&quot; features the wide gauge trains F 90 and the H 01.<br><br><strong>F 90:</strong><br><br>In 1974 the series F (F74) was being built and then further developed. The F90 was built from 1990 to 1991. The outline and constructual parts of the train are rather plain and simple compared to the modern H series. Nevertheless it shows the timeless elegance (if one can say so) of the 70´s and 80`s. These trains were built by ABB Henschel.<br><br><strong>H 01:</strong><br><br>The H 01 is one of the most modern vehicles of the Berlin Subway System. This wide gauge train has been built between 2000 and 2002. These trains were built by ABB Henschel, Adtranz, Bombardier. The H train is usually a set of 6 cars. This system allows a seamless transition between the cars of the trains resulting in 100 m long distance wher the passenger can walk through from end to end.Highlights<br>Besides being the longest Berlin Subway route it has some more features which are worth mentioning.<br><br>The underground route is really entertaining and exiting as is has many turns and gradients on offer. Just before the Mehringdamm/Gneisenaustr. crossroads for example it does a very hard left turn in a radius of not even 100 m, one of the most difficult turns in the Berlin Subway system.<br><br>Impressive 2 level tunnel sections such as in the area of Mehringdamm and Jungfernheide, many chamber locks at the underground sections of the rivers and canals which close rapidly when water comes through, are another feature.<br><br>The stations architechture holds a lot of varieties, here´s a description of two of them:<br><br>First we´d like to mention the station Hermannplatz.. Being 7 m high, 132 m long and 22 m wide, its almost a cathedral. The first subway escalators were introduced here in 1926 with another highlight coming three years later. The year 1929 the department store Karstadt opened at Hermannplatz, at this time the most modern store in all of Europe. The Karstadt company paid part of the costs of building tis pompous station and in return got a direct entrance to its store. Even today still almost unique.<br><br>When designing &quot;Zitadelle&quot;, inspiration came purely from the nearby Spandau citadel, one of the most important medieval fortresses of Europe and one of the many touristical attractions of Berlin and the district of Spandau.<br><br>Don`t miss to visit the official TML-Studios website at: <a>http://www.world-of-subways.com</a>",

        "description": "World of Subways&quot; is our series of the most interesting Subway and Underground routes of the world for the PC. After the releases of New York and Berlin we are now proud to introduce Vol.3 - London Underground. This simulation covers the entire Circle Line in its current operational service which includes the new section to Hammersmith. This line offers a length of 27km with 35 stations, many hours of fun and interesting missions<br><br>The Circle Line is an underground service of the London Underground circling the center of London. It was first described as such in 1949 and already appeared on the 1947 Underground Map. It had not been built as a separate line, but was merged from different sections of the Metropolitan Line and the District Line. Only two short sections of this line are solely used by the Circle line. These sections are the connecting curves between the stations of High Street Kensington and Gloucester Road and between Aldgate and Tower Hill.Features<br><ul><li>3D - Cockpit with rotatable camera<br></li><li>Original virtual reproductions of 35 stations on the Circle Line<br></li><li>Free movement in the train and at the stations (accomplished for the first time ever!)<br></li><li>More realistic AI trains, dynamic passengers on the platforms<br></li><li>Superb graphics, reflecting headlights, night effects<br></li><li>Realistic announcements recorded exclusively by the original speaker</li></ul>Tube map<br><a></a>Physics<br>The physics have been developed based on real values, such as those used in training simulators. The driving and braking characteristics of the trains are reproduced faithfully and reflect the feeling to actually controlling a train of the London Underground.Graphics<br>Compared to the first two products in this series, Vol. 3 uses a new 3D engine. The simulator is now based on the Vision Engine Trinigy, which made it possible to substantially improve lighting and 3D effects. At the same time the stability and performance of the 3D engine has been improved.",

A young heroine is called to fight him, but first she must survive the harsh environment, battle hostile trolls, and deal with many creatures and characters from the classic myths.<br><br>Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok is an adventure / RPG hybrid. Like in many adventure games, you have a world to save, and must use your wit, guile and inventory to puzzle your way through. Like in many roleplaying games, you can customize your character with various classes and skills, and must train yourself in combat to stand a chance against the fierce monsters in your way. Each class has her own solution to the numerous obstacles, where the warrior is the most straightforward to play, the sorceress focuses on smart solutions and finding the right spell for the situation, and the rogue cheats her way through life without getting caught. <br><br>The game is designed in the spirit and atmosphere of the classics, and strives to have the same high quality of art, music, and plot. With multiple character classes and several solutions to many puzzles, there are plenty of options for further replayability. The game has been voted voted <strong>69th All-Time Best Computer RPG</strong> by RpgCodex. It is available completely for free, or as we like to call it, priceless.<br><br>&quot;The attention to detail is staggering ... Heroine’s Quest is a glorious adventure-RPG hybrid.&quot; - RockPaperShotgun<br>&quot;As perfect a tribute to Sierra's classic Quest for Glory series as you could hope for.&quot; Kotaku<br>&quot;It's great to see a female-centric heroic quest.&quot; - Corey Cole<br>&quot;I was still discovering new quests and things to do even on a third playthrough.&quot; - Last Token",

Centuries after planetfall, colonists are still struggling to gain foothold on their lush and alien planet. You settle on the frontier by carefully managing resources, production and different personalities.<br>Characters and alien wildlife are brought to life through a rigorous simulation and the game plays out as a tug-of-war between humans and nature on a planet full of opportunities and dangers. <br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>Indirect control -- the colonists are free and have a democratic society. Dissatisfied people can either leave or vote for improving their colony: Only if you have ambitious inhabitants will you access better technology and develop a camp into a comfortable town.<br><br>-Realistic sci-fi, pioneer setting<br>-Simulation of alien nature, human needs and frontier community<br>-Detailed, flexible crafting<br>...We draw inspiration from ‘The Settlers’, ‘Dwarf Fortress’ and Paradox games.<br><br><strong>Setting</strong><br>The game takes place in a realistic sci-fi setting, in a plausible future without Faster-than-Light travel. Humans landed on a Tau Ceti planet in 2238 after a 100 year journey. Over the generations, the Tau Ceti colonists lost the advanced equipment which was brought to the planet and the descendants formed simple frontier societies based on farming, fishing and trade.<br><br>----------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Open-ended maps and scenarios</strong><br>In various scenarios and maps we explore the history of the planet's colonization. The tutorials and scenarios introduce you to the game's setting and mechanics and make you ready to tackle the open-ended maps where you build up a colony from scratch.<br><br>Fields of Tau Ceti are open-ended maps that take place in a primitive future centuries after planetfall. You begin with a community equipped for either hunting, farming or fishing and work off the land. Apart from an old robot, the people use simple technology such as smithing, small scale farming and black powder.<br><br>Fields of Tau Ceti currently has 2 maps + 1 large map version for powerful PCs.<br><br>Muckroot Mining Site is an open-ended map where a mining crew is extracting metals in a dangerous biome: They use advanced weapons for protection against the wildlife. They can start a settlement, mixing advanced and primitive tech.<br><br>Twinkler Island is a scenario with a team of planet explorers that have crash-landed on an island and must wait for rescue. There will be attacks by pack predators, the so-called “twinklers” which emerge from the caves littering the island.<br><br>Making Headway is an open-ended scenario where you grow a small farm community by expanding into rubber production, extracting sap from a dangerous swamp.<br><br>The Clay Pit is an open-ended tutorial where a scruffy crew of laborers make mudbricks for sale. See if you can turn the camp into a permanent settlement.<br><br>Castaways is a tutorial scenario that teaches you the game as you guide a group of stranded sailors to find food, fight 'bush dragons' and build a signal pyre on top of an island. <br><br>-The maps and scenarios are hand-made but we ensure replayability by randomizing starting location, number of resources, colonists, trade goods, animals etc.<br><br>CONTENT:<br>As of release, the game includes<br>94 structures<br>31 animals<br>~450 items (ingredients, materials, tools, gadgets, weapons, upgrades etc.)<br>17 plant species<br><br>-------------------------------------",

Players will use wits, stealth and sometimes even a little force to investigate, explore, and acquire ever more clues for their big string-covered wall of conspiracies. <br><br>Season One of Majestic Nights takes place over six chapters, which work as a complete story or as standalone experiences. ‘Chapter Zero’, a prologue to the series, will be made available for free.

        "name": "BeamNG.drive",
        "description": "BeamNG.drive is a realistic, immersive driving game offering near-limitless possibilities. Our soft-body physics engine simulates every component of a vehicle in real time, resulting in realistic, dynamic behavior.                                        <br>The driving feel is authentic and visceral, and crashes are realistic and violent; yet the physics are accessible enough to drive with a keyboard or gamepad while still being authentic with a full racing wheel with uncompromising realism.<br><br>Environments and vehicles in BeamNG.drive are hand-crafted with passionate attention to detail. With years of meticulous design, research, and experience, we authentically recreate the feeling and excitement of real world driving.<br><br>We are a small team from around the world with no obligations to publishers or outside interests. Our users and modding community are our first priority. Help us make BeamNG.drive the ultimate driving experience and discover what an open and uncompromising soft-body vehicle simulator can be.Why is BeamNG.drive the game for you?<br>As an open world vehicle simulator, BeamNG.drive will cover a large array of vehicular disciplines - everything from a delivery mission in a box truck to a high speed rally race or a destruction derby. The vehicle customization and detail will allow you to make your car or truck all your own - fix it up, upgrade it, or strip away body panels to reduce weight. There are a lot of different types of gameplay we want to implement beyond just racing and crashing, such as police chases, stunt challenges, and other specialized minigames. Eventually we would like to have some kind of single player open world career mode, with persistent vehicle ownership and procedurally generated used vehicles to buy and events to run them in.<br><br>In some ways, BeamNG.drive is about doing anything you want with a car or truck - the stuff other games don't let you do. You can go off-roading in a family sedan or hurl a delivery truck around a racing circuit, all with beautiful soft-body simulation physics. You can mod those same vehicles to be racing beasts, derby monsters, or off-road behemoths - or just thrash them stock. At the end of the day, BeamNG.drive gives you the gameplay you want, and doesn't force you to do anything that you don't think is fun or interesting.The future of the game and our physics engine<br>As we optimize our game and computer technology improves, the amount of vehicles which can be simultaneously simulated at a smooth framerate will increase. Right now you can run 4 to 6 cars at one time on a high end quad-core processor. Each vehicle has around 400 nodes and 4000 beams, all being simulated 2000 times per second. We hope to expand the number of simultaneous vehicles possible to at least 8 with a mid-range processor.<br><br>We will also look towards having multiplayer in the future, but it may be some time before we can create the multiplayer experience everyone is expecting. We are well aware of the demand for multiplayer and we want it just as much as you, but for the short term we are focusing on the single player career mode, various driving events, fixing bugs, and creating more content. It is feasible that we could implement local and/or same PC multiplayer in the interim.<br><br>Also, the possibilities extend beyond land vehicles. Users in our community have already made planes and helicopters that fly purely with the existing vehicle aerodynamic physics, with no cheating whatsoever. BeamNG can simulate aircraft in a very authentic way due to its soft-body physics. All the flex that happens to a real plane's airframe arises naturally in BeamNG, and the consequences of excessive stress are also modeled. Fly too fast and your wings will start to bend and rip off. The potential for the BeamNG physics engine is huge.Alpha Access Features<ul>    <li>All future updates to BeamNG.drive included for free (alpha, beta), also including the final game<br>    </li><li>Soft-body physics sandbox<br>    </li><li>19 detailed, customizable, destructible vehicles, with more to come<br>    </li><li>10 terrains to explore and drive across, with more to come<br>    </li><li>Frequent updates adding terrains, vehicles, features, gameplay, and bug fixes<br>    </li><li>Full modding and content creation capabilities - make maps and vehicles, and script gameplay<br>    </li><li>Use the built-in terrain editor and any 3D modeling, image editing, and text editing software<br>    </li><li>Online authentication is only necessary to update; the game itself does not need an internet connection to run.</li></ul>Alpha TestersUsers that already entered the alpha testing via our website can get a free Steam key.Our goalsOur main focus is on how things move rather than how things look on the screen. We aim to bring our expertise in real time soft-body physics and soft-body physics model design to the forefront of game physics simulation, making available the technology and know-how to as a wide an audience as possible. To achieve this, we are designing the engine and corresponding assets, so as to be independent of the underlying game engine and operating system.<br><br>Right now the physics engine is running on a multicore CPU configuration, but we are also in the process of supporting GPUs via OpenCL.Our missionTo have realistic, accurate, destructible, and malleable physics everywhere. To make anything possible.More Feedback<br>More Feedback can be found there: <a>http://www.beamng.com/content/119-Feedback</a>Contact UsYou can get in touch with us in several ways:<br><ul>    <li> <strong>Use our forums</strong>: <a>http://www.beamng.com/forum/</a><br>    </li><li> <strong>Via email</strong>: <a>http://www.beamng.com/contactus/</a> or <a>support@beamng.com</a><br>    </li><li> <strong>Follow us on Twitter</strong>: <a>http://twitter.com/beamng</a><br>    </li><li> <strong>Subscribe to our YouTube channel</strong>: <a>http://youtube.com/user/beamng</a><br>    </li><li> <strong>Visit our Facebook page</strong>: <a>http://facebook.com/BeamNGPhysics</a></li></ul>",

The only trouble is Praymos is not only inhabited but has a technological civilization similar to that of Earth of the second half of 20th century.  The result was a battle not just for control of the resource, but the entire planet.GameplayRoboWars is easy to play yet difficult to master.

Turn the tide with the mighty Imperial Knight (Space Marine), the clattering Gorkanaut (Ork), or the haunting Wraithknight (Eldar).<strong>COLOSSAL BATTLES</strong><br>Dawn of War is famous for its epic action and those immense clashes are back - but now they're off-the-scale. Wage war with massive armies across violent volcanic terrain or mighty orbital Star Forts.<strong>CALL UP YOUR ELITES</strong><br>Take your battle plans to another level by deploying powerful collectible elite squads, each boasting their own special abilities and bonuses that will help you unlock and develop new attacking strategies to conquer your foes.<strong>DESTRUCTIVE ABILITIES</strong><br>Cause devastation on the battlefield with powerful super-abilities. Rain down total destruction on your enemies with the Space Marine's Orbital Bombardment, the Eldar's blistering Eldritch Storm or the Ork’s Rokks to counter your unsuspecting rivals.<strong>THREE-FACTION CAMPAIGN</strong><br>Learn what makes each force formidable through alternating missions. You'll soon come to understand the combat advantages of Space Marines, Orks, and Eldar and the rules of a universe with no heroes or villains… only war.<strong>A NEW DAWN ONLINE</strong><br>Your army will wreak havoc online. Join the multiplayer community and forge new alliances - or turn the tables on your new 'friends' as they become foes in explosive, chaotic and competitive maps.<strong>ONE ARMY TO RULE</strong><br>Customize your own universal army from the very first moment you are matched in a melee.

Play as the hero Carrion Iblis, as the story of Siegfried, the Empire's true successor, plunges the world further and further into darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmerse yourself in a world of conflict as several opposing factions clash for dominance over the Archaelus Empire and its people. Take up the mighty blade of Carrion Iblis as he and his friends tear through a massive web of manipulation. Theirs is a journey that will crack open the doors of destiny, setting the stage for a truly epic struggle for the fate of the world! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this adventure, Carrion must clash against enemies from within and without. He will face down his own countrymen, repel an invasion of undead foes, conquer his personal demons, find love, and challenge the power of the heavens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeadly Sin 2 is a 20-30 hour fantasy RPG epic. It is not a direct sequel to Deadly Sin 1; much like the games in the Final Fantasy series, Deadly Sin 2 is merely the next in a line of spiritual successors to the original. Deadly Sin 2 boasts a massively improved battle and menu system, as well as all-new features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) A fully scripted, back-view, conditional turn-based battle system by Mithran. This is a sophisticated evolution of the traditional RPG battle formula that includes a winner-take-all threat system, and new stats, including Speed, Build, Shield Block, MP Regen, and Equipment Weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) An original soundtrack written by the game creator, Harmonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) A large amount of dynamic, enjoyable, and rewarding side-quests that bring the world to life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Augment system: customize any weapon, shield, or helm/body/arm armor with augments that you find or purchase around the world. Augments add stats, status effects, elemental changes, and other enhancements that are endlessly fun to play around with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) In-depth skill point system: each PC has a unique skill tree. Invest skill points gained from leveling up or completing quests. If you don't like how your character is developing, you can have your skill points refunded at an inn! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) Monster nodes: find these nodes to disable random encounters and obtain skill points. If you want to fight enemies again, the monster nodes can be turned back on at your will! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n7) Mouse interface: you can use the mouse to do almost everything, including movement. You can choose not to use the mouse by simply moving it off screen. Use Alt-Enter to toggle full screen mode.",

        "description": "Prepare yourself for an insatiable rain of bullets, bombs, and beams in Crimzon Clover. From Japanese indie developer YOTSUBANE, AdventurePlanningService, this unique top-down shooter is a wild ride you won't want to miss out on.<br><br>Your first step in Crimzon Clover: World Ignition is as simple as choosing how you want to play, and which powerful ship will be yours to command. Choose your difficulty from ARCADE (true to the original arcade game) or NOVICE (better if these are your first step in the world of hardcode SHMUP) then choose your mode from Boost, Original, Unlimited, and Time Attack.<br><br>Original is THE main mode, where you blast your way through stage in search of the last boss. Boost Mode will adjust the difficulty based on how proficient you are at devastating your enemies. Unlimited turns each stage into an intense battlefield of bullets that only the most hardcore players will be able to survive. Time Attack pits you against the clock as you race to make the best score possible in about 3 minutes.<br><br>Take the role of a skilled pilot in the fight to destroy massive waves of enemies while dodging their unending rain of bullets. Each of the three ships has their own style of standard firing and a unique appearance. The firing style is translated beautifully as you amp your way into Break Mode and Double Break Mode! As you blast through your foes in each stage you can collect stars that will raise your score. Each enemy destroyed helps fill your Break Meter, which allows you to wipe the screen with powerful bombs or, if you have the patience, blast off into Break Mode to add a huge boost to your firepower and let you rip through enemies with ease. That's not the extent of your strength though, as having a full Break Meter while in Break Mode will allow you to enter the ultimately destructive Double Break Mode. Watch your enemies crumble in fear as you turn the tide and fill the screen with your own hellacious rain of firepower!<br><br>Having a tough time to clear the game using no continue? No worries. Hit up the Training screen to set up your own scenario using your choice of mode, ship, stage, and freely customize other variables to practice the fight for survival. Training doesn't seem like a bad idea after you see what the enemies are capable of. Can you pilot your craft through the bullet massacre the enemies have prepared for you? Find out as you play Crimzon Clover: World Ignition!<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><ul><li>Refreshing Gameplay<br>Crimzon Clover puts a much-needed polish on the classic Shoot 'Em Up genre.<br></li><li>Sky Blazing Graphics: Beautiful retro-inspired arcade graphics, revived for the modern gamer in HD (1280x768).<br></li><li>Super-Powered Challenges: Whether you are new to SHMUPs or an old pro, Crimzon Clover has something for everyone.<br></li><li>Cool Replays: Save your best plays to show off to your friends, or to check to see how you can get even better.</li></ul>",

We believe that this growing trend is on the verge of becoming mainstream globally and will play a significant role in defining the future of sports.<br><br>Arena: Cyber Evolution is the result of our passion for this phenomenon and what it can become.  <br>We know that creating a game that is significant and meaningful on the e-sport scene is no small task and this is why that we have involved the player community since the very beginning of the development, when there were no menus, options, or even textures! <br><br>Arena: Cyber Evolution (ACE) is a futuristic physics-based sports game in which players confront each other in 3 vs 3 matches of wits and twitch reflexes.<br>By featuring a MOBA-like champion logic, ACE brings an unprecedented twist to the sports genre by allowing players to choose from a variety of super-powered heroes and what style of gameplay they prefer to build their own team strategies.<br><br>Designed from the ground up around the mouse &amp; keyboard, ACE was not envisioned only as a sport game, but really as a new sport. <br><br>ACE’s ultra-precise control scheme allows players to analogically manipulate the disk using simple mouse gestures.<br><br>Just like in real sports, this gameplay allows for super intuitive gameplay while proposing nearly infinite depth &amp; skill cap.<br><br><ul><li>An unique blend of action games, sports games and MOBA.<br></li><li>The closest experience to playing a traditional sport in a video game.<br></li><li>Dynamic physics-based gameplay that is both deep and accessible.<br></li><li>Innovative mouse gesture control allows for fluid and natural actions (passes, shots, intercepts and jukes).<br></li><li>Having all human players makes positioning meaningful and allow for infinite team strategies.<br></li><li>Several characters each with unique powers and play styles<br></li><li>Unlock implants (to improve and customize your characters), team boosts, upgrades, and special abilities.<br></li><li>Very fun to watch as a spectator - even without prior knowledge of the game.<br></li><li>New characters, implants, custom arenas, events, challenges, and much more coming soon! New updates regularly!</li></ul><br><br>Arena: Cyber Evolution is free to play and we want it to stay this way forever. We believe that it should be at the core of any sport to be accessible for everyone to play and practice no matter what.<br>As an independent game studio, we however need some money to keep developing the game and improving it.  <br><br>This is why we integrated monetization features in the game with the possibility to buy skins, hats and other customizations with real money (but never pay to win mechanics!).  For us, this is a simple way to allow players who really enjoy and believe in the game to support its continued development by ‘’donating’’ and receiving rewards for it.<br><br>In addition to the items available in-game, the following great packages are available as DLC:Supporters Pack DLC<a></a>Founders Pack DLC<a></a>Champions Pack DLC<a></a>Pillar Pack DLC<a></a>MoreFor more opportunities to support us, please visite our <a>web page</a>!",

It offers a thrilling campaign, instant action combat sessions as well as a sandbox mode allowing you to explore the game's universe while battling hostile Insurgent forces among others. <br><br>Missions take place in space and on the surface of planets and range from basic escort and recon missions, to highly engaging and dangerous tactical strike missions.<br><br>Many years have passed since the Gammulans invaded the sol system in full force and all but decimated the inhabitants of the planetary systems. cites were<br>completely devastated and entire continents wiped out.<br><br>In their wake, they left a splintered Galactic Command (GALCOM) alliance still engaged in a fierce battle with insurgents who oppose the alliance.<br><br>Stretched to the limit Galactic Command scientists developed a new space craft that is lighter, faster and more powerful than any before it. Episode One begins with this new Engstrom class carrier's first day in a live combat engagement.<br><br>Your Echo fighter squadron of fighters has been assigned to the WildStar battle fleet led by the GCV-Excalibur in operations against the Insurgent uprising.<br><br>As an Elite Force Pilot and leader of the Echo fighter wing assigned to IIS starstation  in orbit around Titan, your fighter squad is tasked with leading a series of defensive and offensive missions against the Insurgents occupying Sol territories. <br><br>Unlike our other larger capital ship series (Battlecruiser, Universal Combat) Echo Squad SE takes place within the confines of the Terran Quadrant which spans the following star systems. So in sandbox mode, you are restricted to this quadrant.<br><br>SOL, ALPHA CENTAURI, BARNARD’S STAR, SIRIUS, OMICRON ERIDANI, TAU CETI, POLARIS, PROCYON<br><br>Echo Squad was first developed in 2007-2008 for Turner’s GameTap service. When that service was sold off (to Metaboli), the game rights reverted. A few months later we decided to update and improve the game. It was later released in early 2009 as Echo Squad SE. The game uses our legacy game engine first released in 2009 for the original Echo Squad SE. The much larger Universal Combat Collector’s Edition v2.0 game is also derived from this engine.<br><br>By popular demand, we decided to remaster and release an updated version of the game for the first time on Steam. More info available on the <a>game's web page</a>.",

The game is addictive enough that you will want to complete it a few times in order to piece together the whole story and of course the co-op mode will also eat up a lot of your spare time if you have friends nearby. While shooter fans will obviously enjoy the game the most I urge anyone that has an interest in polished, unique titles to try it out as it is definitely worth the effort. Rating: 8/10&quot;  <strong><a>GAMERamble</a></strong>  June 2014<br><br>&quot;Enemy Mind is an excellent and unique take on the shooter genre. Definitely worth the price at full retail.&quot;  <strong><a>Nerd Age</a></strong>  June 2014<br><br>Check out our website: <a>http://enemymindgame.com/</a><br>Listen to the full soundtrack on our <a>Bandcamp Page!</a><br>This old-school arcade shmup is brought to you by <a><strong>Schell Games</strong></a>, an independent game studio based in Pittsburgh, PA.",

Scavenge, craft and buy new parts in order to survive and become the ultimate planetary prospector.<br><br>Start your career as an Intergalactic prospector in search of profit and glory in Campaign, build to your heart's content in Creative mode or pit your Techs against the clock in the Gauntlet Challenge.<br><br>Team up with other intrepid prospectors in Co-op Campaign, build and create together in Co-op Creative, go head-to-head for glory in the Deathmatch Arena or battle for supremacy in Sumo.<br><br>Using the building blocks, guns, wheels, and wings from several Mining Corporations, you can build varied Techs to suit every purpose. Be it powerful armoured combat vehicles, unstoppable resource gathering machines, sprawling resource processing bases or a hybrid of all three - creativity is your key to exo-planetary success.<br><br>The worlds in TerraTech are procedurally generated and infinite, so there are always new lands to discover and more resources to find. Treacherous mountain ranges, luscious grasslands and huge deserts are among the biomes you will encounter. More will be added as development progresses.<br><br>The intergalactic mining industry is a profitable one, but you are not the only miner in search for new worlds to exploit. Defending yourself from rival miners will take time, resources and skill, with success leading to new territory and new lands. All equipable blocks and items can be damaged or destroyed, so ensuring you are sufficiently armed and ready for battle is a key element of both survival and prosperity in TerraTech. Get out there and show them who’s boss!<br><br>By gathering and processing natural resources, players are able to construct storage, refining and construction bases in order to craft new blocks in the game. Like the look of that Venture Hail Fire Rifle that just tore your vehicle apart? Go prospecting for the needed resources, and craft a couple for yourself in the shiny new Venture fabricator which you just aquired, by beating their time trial challenge in the nearby mountains.<br><br>All exo-planetary prospectors buy parts from the established Mining Corporations, where each have their own specific brand of mining technology. Get the job done with GSO, strip-mine to the max with the heavy-duty GeoCorp, zoom around with high-performance recon specialists Venture, function with military efficiency utilising the stealth focused Hawkeye or gain technological superiority with Enviro-giants Better Future. New Corporations we’re aiming to add to the game include deranged experimental scientists Reticule Research, and the hive-mind AI swarms of LEGION. Completing missions and discovering blocks for each Corp will improve your standing with them, and gain access to the more sought-after components in their arsenal.<br><br><strong>Please check the System Requirements to ensure your PC is compatible.</strong>",

        "description": "<strong>Q*bert is Back  @!#?@! </strong><br><br>One of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful arcade games of the 1980s is back in its Classic pixel perfect 2D form, and a re-imagined Reboot version with state of the art 3D game-play and graphics that remain faithful to the original concept. Both versions are exciting twitch games requiring keen puzzle solving skills and logic. <br><br>First introduced in 1982 by Gottlieb, Q*bert was critically-acclaimed and went on to become the third most successful arcade game of all time (behind Pac-Man and Donkey Kong). It inspired home versions, a variety of Q*bert merchandise, numerous copycat games and even an animated TV series. <br><br>Q*bert Classic stays true to the original in all its jagged 2D pixel art glory, now optimized for the modern PC with mouse and Steam gamepad controls. As the title character, players jump around an isometric cube pyramid and convert each block’s color while avoiding familiar adversaries Coily, Ugg, Slick, Sam, Wrong Way and Red Ball. Levels become progressively harder with more enemies blocking your path and the tiles requiring multiple jumps to change to the required color.<br><br>Q*bert Rebooted takes the arcade classic and catapults it into the 21st century 3D game play that takes full advantage of today’s technologies yet remains faithful to the original Q*bert. Featuring hexagonal blocks instead of squares, Q*bert Rebooted introduces new enemies, playable characters, power-ups, traps, gem collecting and characters, and new ways to play. <br><br><strong>Q*bert Rebooted highlights:</strong><br><ul><li>Level Select – replay all previously unlocked levels and track progress against friends.<br></li><li>7 New Playable Characters – introducing Q*zard, Q*bertha, Q*bot, Q*zilla, Q*tee, Q*knight and Q*nicorn, all based on the original Q*bert form.<br></li><li>3 New Enemies – the classic cast of adversaries are joined by new enemies Homer, Uppercut and Treasure Chest<br></li><li>9 Achievements – these include Classic Master, Newbert, Qbertorama, Snake Surprise, Green Machine, Ugg!, Down for the Count, Disc Rider  and Coin-Op Collector.</li></ul>",

        "description": "Being originally designed and developed for the SEGA Mega Drive &amp; SEGA Genesis, Pier Solar is a turn-based RPG with state-of-the-art aesthetics about the journey of three young heroes from the town of Reja. In this prospered and peaceful town there live three best friends: Hoston, Alina and Edessot. Young and curious, they want to go on a herb-seeking quest to help cure Hoston's father's mysterious illness. Little do they know ... it will be the beginning of their lifetime journey where they will learn the true meaning of friendship and the thrill of adventure.<br><br>This journey will demand their courage and wisdom to solve a long-lost mystery while they face the forces of destruction dispatched by an evil man who is trying to change the world for his own good. Through this escapade, they will be reborn as great heroes to protect the universe from a mistaken purpose..<strong>What makes Pier Solar so special?</strong><br>Pier Solar was originally designed and developed for the SEGA Mega Drive and SEGA Genesis. Yes, you read that right!! It was actually the only newly  developed game for SEGA's 16-bit system in the new millennium. It's not a port, fan translation, or a copy of any other game. Pier Solar is a 100% brand new, entirely original,16-bit RPG.<br><br>We'll get right in to what we think makes Pier Solar so special:<br><ul><li><strong>A 100% Original RPG!</strong> Pier Solar was developed from the ground up. An original world, storyline, soundtrack, characters, enemies, and battle style. No ports, translations or copying from any other game - it's all fresh! The first original 16-bit RPG to do this in over a decade!<br><br></li><li><strong>A Massive World to Explore!</strong> Pier Solar has 50+ hours of gameplay, over 300 locations, nearly 500 unique treasure chests, and over 800 NPCs!<br><br></li><li><strong>Director's cut!</strong> Pier Solar expands what was the biggest 16-bit RPG Ever! We released Pier Solar on a custom 64MEG cartridge (the average SEGA Mega Drive/Genesis game size is 12MEG), making it the biggest 16-bit RPG ever! This allowed us to push the 16-bit medium to a precedent setting level, with state-of-the-art aesthetics and things like full-screen cut scenes, background scaling and 3D modes. But Pier Solar HD is more than just a port, the game is getting a Director's cut, and includes an expanded story with new locations and challenges, that couldn't fit on its original Sega Genesis/Mega Drive release. <br><br></li><li><strong>Epic Battle Tactics!</strong> We developed an innovative battle system that puts you in control of up to five characters and includes in-depth strategic moves such as counter-attacks and a special strategy called Gather, which stores energy to unleash even more powerful moves and spells!<br><br></li><li><strong>Translated in 6 Languages!</strong> Pier Solar is translated in 6 languages: English, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German.<br><br></li><li><strong>An Original Soundtrack!</strong> A beautiful soundtrack written just for Pier Solar that embodies everything great about a classic retro soundtrack!<br><br></li><li><strong>There Are Surprises!</strong> We also packed-in many other surprises and secrets like hidden areas and mini-games!</li></ul><br>Pier Solar truly is a love letter to the rich, imaginative 16-bit RPGs of a bygone era. We crafted Pier Solar in the same light - with an authentic adventure, that resonates deeply about life, death, love, family, and friendship. Remember the wonder you felt when immersed into your favorite retro RPG? Pier Solar captures that same wonder.<strong>What the media says about Pier Solar</strong><br>“...this is a game I'll be keeping on my radar. I love the style, the aesthetics, and the classic<br>JRPG feel.”<br><strong>- <a>Kotaku.com</a></strong><br><br>“...one promising title to play next December.”<br><strong>- Destructoid</strong><br><br>“Pier Solar bears the distinct honour of being a Sega Mega Drive game”<br><strong>- Eurogamer</strong><br><br>“WaterMelon’s attention to detail is staggering…a community-based development team with a<br>track record of integrity and a proving capacity to deliver on promises made”<br><strong>- <a>Gamespot.com</a></strong><br><br>“With a lengthy script, impressive graphics, and a top-notch soundtrack, those that still hold the<br>flame for SEGA’s console will have something new to be nostalgic over.<br><strong>- <a>IGN.com</a></strong><br><br>“The game itself, which comes on a high-density, 64 Meg cartridge, is a well-crafted love letter<br>to the turn-based, role playing games of a bygone era. It’s evocative of the 16-bit classics<br>Phantasy Star II and The Secret of Mana, both in scope and design. Pier Solar also sports an<br>enhanced CD soundtrack that truly takes the overall experience to another level.”<br><strong>- <a>1UP.com</a></strong><br><br>“90% GOLD Award…the best RPG of Sega’s 16 bit…well developed [and] well written.”<br><strong>- Games Tribune</strong><strong>In a nutshell</strong><br>Pier Solar is a product of passion, done by individuals who love video games in it's most pure essence. It's made by players for players. Our team has absolute commitment to the quality of the game as well as the experience of the players.",

Player can drive his tank from the driver’s station, fire from the gunner’s station, and command his tank crew and whole unit from the commander’s station.

        "description": "Senseï is the undisputed chieftain. His followers are well versed in every extortion, infiltration and martial art. Pony and Biki are his best students, his pride and joy. The duo knows the secret chakra technique like the back of their hand (or hoof in Pony's case). Together they rule the city and its surroundings. Although everyone respects and fears them they are hunted by law enforcement agencies. <br><br>They are Ninjas. <br><br>Crouching Pony Hidden Dragon (CPHD) is a brand-new Action/RPG game developed for SNK’s Neo Geo console which came out in 1990.<br><br>It might look like a straight-forward arcade game, but under the surface is a persistent world with a rich and varied set of rules. In CPHD “Run’N Gun” mechanics from the likes Shock Troopers or Ninja commando are combined with playful “RPG” ones from games like Zelda or Secret of Mana. <br><br>You'll need to explore every level to find the resources necessary for your progress: coins, health bonuses, resurrection potions, special Ninja techniques, etc. Treasure chests are hidden everywhere. You’ll have to find them to afford equipment upgrades from the ninja shops. In addition Pony and Biki gain experience points by defeating enemies, becoming more powerful over time. Be careful though: you’ll have to use your resources wisely. Health is limited so if you don't equip yourself at the armory you're in for a hard time. Money is limited too however: you'll need to choose these investments carefully!<br><br>Make new friends: a local multiplayer co-op mode lets a second player drop in at any time. It’s even more fun, even more frantic and even more strategic!<br><br>Lose old friends: there are the same numbers of resources no matter how many players there are; will you share or will you hog everything? <br><br>Have a good adventure!Why create a game for Neo Geo?Several reasons pushed us to develop for this console. The Neo-Geo is a legend amongst consoles, and is the one we dreamed of throughout our childhood and teenage years. For this reason, when we decided to bring our main character “Ninja Pony” to life, we wanted his early adventures to take place in the Neo-Geo universe. Thus we are offering our beloved Pony this welcoming present: to be born into the world of this “Rolls Royce” of consoles. Having our character emerge on cartridge is a way of enshrining him in the Pantheon of video game heroes, alongside Sonic and Mario. It's a way of going back in time! It also made sense with regards to the character's back-story. Crouching Pony Hidden Dragon relates the teenage years of Ninja Pony. This parallels the advent of the Neo-Geo in the history of video games: this console personifies gaming's teenage years. <br><br>Last but not least there were technical challenges we were eager to overcome. We realized that there were very few traces of the tools and documentation required to develop games on Neo-Geo. What's more this arcane knowledge was gradually disappearing! <br>We had to become archaeologists, investigating, looking for clues, piecing together how these games were developed. We created our own software and hardware pipe-lines, started working directly in pixel art again, etc. We were able to leverage our experience working on “modern” video games in returning to blow the dust off these old techniques. It was an exciting job, a true act of video game craftsmanship!Why bring the game to PC?When we announced the Neo Geo version many expressed regret at not being able to play the game. Since our main ambition at Le Cortex is to offer original play experiences to as many people as possible we wanted to avoid restricting the release to Neo-Geo connoisseurs and collectors. So we decided to port the game to the gamers' platform of today: the PC. And in case you were wondering this is indeed a full native port, not the Neo-Geo ROM being run via an emulator!About Le CortexLe Cortex is an independent French Studio located in Paris. We design, write and develop games which aim to offer brand new play experiences.",

        "description": "<strong>It's 1972 and a military coup has rocked Anchuria, a small country in Latin America. As a result, you, Angela Burnes, US citizen, are trapped in the metropolitan capital of San Bavón. Your paradise has turned into a warzone. To make ends meet, you take up a job as a housekeeper. Every week, an hour before sunset, you clean the swanky bachelor pad of the wealthy Gabriel Ortega. You are given a number of tasks to do, but the temptation to go through his stuff is irresistible. And what is he up to? As you get to know your mysterious absent employer better, you are sucked into a rebellious plot against the notorious dictator who rules the country with an iron fist.</strong><br><br>“Sunset uses the routine of labour to exquisite effect as a framework to tell a story about class and political revolution.” – Simon Parkin, <a>Eurogamer</a><br><br>“Sunset acts as a thoughtful, pensive walk through social themes and struggles not often explored in this medium.” – Game Spot, <a>Josiah Renaudin</a><br><br>“Sunset is a wonderfully atmospheric slow burner and a valuable addition to a medium where the predominant approach to conflict is to just give you a big old gun and invite you to get stuck in.” – Philippa Warr, <a>Rock Paper Shotgun</a><br><br>“The story is excellent and will draw you in, making you feel as if you truly are Angela Burnes.” – Jessica Mock, <a>Hardcore Gamer</a><br><br>“Rather than focus on the explicit violence of a military coup, Sunset centers on the emotional brutality of war.” – Reid McCarter, <a>Playboy</a><br><br>Sunset is a narrative-driven first-person exploration game that centers on the discovery of clues to a story that takes place as you play.<br><br>Sunset is in part inspired by action games set in a war-like context, like many first-person shooters. What life would be like for the NPCs in such games? How does it feel when war is the backdrop for your day-to-day life?<br><br>Sunset is divided into 44 play sessions that each take a fictional hour: until the sun sets. Each time you get a list of tasks that you are requested to do. But there is more to do in the apartment than just work. There are other activities, such as going through the owner's possessions in search of information, and interacting with his 1970s-era technological gadgets.<br><br>Angela Burnes, is not an empty vessel. She has a personality of her own and you discover her thoughts while playing. As a US citizen at the end of the sixties, she is inspired by the Black Power and civil rights movements. In an effort to learn more about egality, she travels to the then socialist republic of Anchuria. During her visit, a US-backed military coup happens and she is disallowed from leaving the country. Her university degree is not recognized by the new regime and she is forced to work as a housekeeper to sustain herself.<br><br>Angela's younger brother, David, who had followed her to Anchuria ends up joining an underground resistance movement. And Angela must worry about what happens to him when the war begins in earnest.<br><br>Gabriel Ortega is a lover of the arts. Through his work as a curator he met Maria Luisa of the wealthy Veleta family. Thanks to the money from their families, Gabriel became a much celebrated benefactor of the arts. When the coup happened, theaters and museums were closed. The new government offered affluent citizens safety and positions of power. Gabriel's wife, and most of her family and their friends, were happy to accept but Gabriel refused. Rising tensions between the couple ultimately lead to a separation.<br><br><strong>The story of Sunset begins when Gabriel Ortega moves into a new penthouse apartment in the capital city of San Bavón.

        "description": "The Complete Season of The Council grants you access to all 5 episodes.<br><br>The Council is an episodic game like no other. Delivering a fresh new take on the Narrative Adventure, your choices and character growth truly matter. Make hard-hitting decisions, but also develop an array of skills to directly impact how the story unfolds. With permanent, long-lasting consequences, there is no going back. Plunge into a tale of intrigue and manipulation in the style of a classic murder mystery, living with a cast of alluring characters each hiding their own dark secrets. Trust no one while uncovering dire truths – no matter the cost to mind and body.<br><br>The Council begins in 1793, with players taking the role of secret society member Louis de Richet after his invitation to a private island off the shores of England by the enigmatic Lord Mortimer. Joining him are a number of high profile guests, including Napoleon Bonaparte and President of the newly-formed United States of America, George Washington. The strange nature of this private reception goes beyond just the prestigious guests –Richet’s own mother has recently gone missing on the island, while each and every one of the colorful cast seems to have their own hidden agendas.<br><br>In a new twist for the genre, the core of The Council’s gameplay comes from manipulating and maneuvering through character encounters using the unique Social Influence system. During confrontations, skills and limited resources can be used to gain the upper hand and achieve the desired outcome. Players will be rewarded for their knowledge of each character’s psychological vulnerabilities and immunities, as well as their preparations made during prior exploration and investigation. Failing an encounter does not mean ‘game over’, and no action can be taken back. The consequences are permanent, and may result in persistent physical disfigurements or mental traits that help or hinder the rest of the player’s adventure.<br><br>Richet’s numerous skills can be developed to align with your chosen approach to the adventure. Solve issues with diplomacy, delve into occultism to expand your historical and scientific knowledge, or play detective and see what others do not perceive. Your skills will have uses that extend far beyond your conversations with fellow guests. With 15 diverse skills to use and invest in, players are free to uncover The Council’s mysteries how they see fit, with wildly varying consequences depending on their methods. The results will forever alter the life of Louis de Richet, of those around him, and shape history as we know it.",

The player is immortalized as a profiler of sorts in this treasure hunt game - a brilliantly vivid historical rendition of the acclaimed quatrains of Nostradamus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adventure begins in the South of France as Salon-de-Provence, and its Royal Family fall prey to unfathomable terrors.  You play as Madeleine de Nostradame, the daughter of the famous astrologer, author and apothecary as she hunts down an assassin who uses astrology to disguise his crimes as fearsome prophecies.

        "description": "In Mini Metro, you take on the task of designing the subway layout for a rapidly expanding city. Your city starts with three stations. Draw routes between these stations to connect them with subway lines. Commuters travel along your lines to get around the city as fast as they can. Each station can only hold a handful of waiting commuters so your subway network will need to be well-designed to avoid delays.<br><br>The city is growing. More stations are opening, and commuters are appearing faster. The demands on your network are ever-increasing. You'll be constantly redesigning your lines to maximise efficiency. The new assets you earn every week will help immensely — as long as they're used wisely.<br><br>Eventually your network will fail. Stations will open too quickly. Commuters will crowd the platforms. How long the city keeps moving is up to you.Key Features<ul><li>Compelling, constructive, hectic, relaxed gameplay. If that makes sense. It doesn't though, aye? You just gotta play it.<br></li><li>Three game modes: Normal for quick scored games, Endless for stress-free sandbox play, and Extreme for the ultimate challenge.<br></li><li>Build your metro exactly how you want to with the all-new Creative mode.<br></li><li>Twenty real-world cities to design subways for (London, New York City, Paris, Berlin, Melbourne, Hong Kong, Osaka, Saint Petersburg, Montréal, San Francisco, São Paulo, Seoul, Washington, D.C., Cairo, Istanbul, Shanghai, Singapore, Stockholm, Mumbai, and Auckland). Each has a unique colour theme, set of obstacles, and pace.<br></li><li>Random city growth, so each game plays out differently. A strategy that proved successful last game may not help you in the next.<br></li><li>Each game's map is a work of art, built by you in the classic abstract subway style of Harry Beck. If you think it's a keeper, save it, tweet it, show it off or make it your desktop background!<br></li><li>Responsive soundtrack created by your metro system, engineered by Disasterpeace.<br></li><li>Colorblind and night modes.<br></li><li>Trains! Did we mention them yet?</li></ul>DemoYou can check out Mini Metro for yourself and play a game on the London map in the <a>demo</a>.",

        "description": "MechRunner is an endless action game that casts you as a powerful mech in stunning cinematic battles against a relentless robotic army.<strong>Game Story</strong>On June 30th, 1908 a mysterious explosion took place over the Tunguska River in Siberia, Russia that wiped out trees and wildlife for over 800 square miles. To this day it remains the largest “impact event” in our planet’s recorded history. <br><br>In the years that followed, dozens of scientific expeditions to the site attempted to explain the disaster but failed to come to any conclusions. In the mid-1940s however, a team of scientists from the Russian secret service visiting the site stumbled upon the wreckage of an alien spacecraft containing technology that far exceeded our own. In the years that followed, the KGB set to work harnessing this mysterious new power source and created a new secret weapons program - The Division of Advanced Weaponry or &quot;O.S.O.&quot;<br><br>They thought they could control the new power they’d discovered, but it began to do more than run their machines. It began to drive the men working on it mad. The man in charge of the O.S.O., General Yuri Petrakoff, seemed particularly affected and on April 14th, 1949, Petrakoff launched a full scale assault on Europe.<br><br>One of Petrakoff’s lead engineers, Jesper Teterev, went AWOL and left the program early, wary of what was happening there. He went to live in secret with his sister, Isabel and niece, Allison. While in hiding however, Jesper (with the help of budding engineer and pilot Allison) was busy building his own mechanized war machine, called the XP-41, certain it may be needed one day to stave off the O.S.O.'s evil creations. He was right.<strong>Gameplay</strong>MechRunner is an endless-style action game mixed with fast and furious mode-changing mech action!<br><br>It is a &quot;runner&quot; in that the player is constantly moving forward while tracking down lethal O.S.O. forces but what makes it special is that you’re piloting a giant robot capable of some serious destruction! Other endless runners feature action elements, but none like this. Heat seeking missiles, heavy caliber bullets, laser cannons, and concussion bombs meet destructible buildings, debris littered streets, and tons of slice-able enemies to create a fast paced, visually stunning experience!<br><br>A typical game may take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to play. The higher your skill, the longer the game, the more rewards you will collect, and the more content you will unlock!<strong>Features</strong><ul><li>Meticulously detailed, fast-paced action<br></li><li>Switch between Tank and Robot modes on the fly<br></li><li>Slice &amp; Dice disabled enemies in cinematic fashion!<br></li><li>Extensive arsenal of weapons, customizations, and power-ups<br></li><li>3 unique environments that blend seamlessly together - you decide when it's time to switch<br></li><li>Procedurally generated levels for endless variety<br></li><li>Numerous enemy types with different tactics<br></li><li>Epic boss battles!<br></li><li>Dynamic environmental obstacles<br></li><li>Unlockable skins, upgrades, and achievements<br></li><li>Rescue civilians and escort them to safety<br></li><li>Amazing Hollywood quality soundtrack<br></li><li>Optional controls - play with a mouse or controller</li></ul>",

        "description": "<strong>Spaceships, lasers, and… chickens! What more could you ask for?</strong><br><br><strong>Conflicks: Revolutionary Space Battles</strong> is a creative new take on space-themed videogames that merges the deep, thoughtful gameplay of strategy games with the intuitive accessibility of physics-based games. <br><br>The game universe is a futuristic alternate history of the European Renaissance that combines elements from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries with science fiction and an oddball sense of humor into a stylized, absurdist world that never takes itself too seriously. Conflicks can be played in a single-player campaign mode where missions are linked together by a story, as well as in competitive battles (against other players or AI).<br><br>Pledge your allegiance to Greater-Britain, the Celestial Empire, the Sacred Alliance or the Sublime Gate and harvest metamatter in the name of your emperor, or join  the Chk’Rathii and lead the Revolution against those poultry-hoarding galactic despots!Main Features<br><ul><li>Original game mechanics based on the principle of flicking.

Become Ruler of the World by establishing and leading a civilization from the Stone Age to the Information Age. Wage war, conduct diplomacy, advance your culture, and go head-to-head with history’s greatest leaders as you attempt to build the greatest civilization the world has ever known.<br><br>Civilization VI offers new ways to engage with your world: cities now physically expand across the map, active research in technology and culture unlocks new potential, and competing leaders will pursue their own agendas based on their historical traits as you race for one of five ways to achieve victory in the game.<br><br><ul><li><strong>EXPANSIVE EMPIRES: </strong>See the marvels of your empire spread across the map like never before. Each city spans multiple tiles so you can custom build your cities to take full advantage of the local terrain.<br></li><li><strong>ACTIVE RESEARCH: </strong>Unlock boosts that speed your civilization’s progress through history. To advance more quickly, use your units to actively explore, develop your environment, and discover new cultures. <br></li><li><strong>DYNAMIC DIPLOMACY:</strong> Interactions with other civilizations change over the course of the game, from primitive first interactions where conflict is a fact of life, to late game alliances and negotiations. <br></li><li><strong>COMBINED ARMS:</strong> Expanding on the “one unit per tile” design, support units can now be embedded with other units, like anti-tank support with infantry, or a warrior with settlers. Similar units can also be combined to form powerful “Corps” units.<br></li><li><strong>ENHANCED MULTIPLAYER:</strong> In addition to traditional multiplayer modes, cooperate and compete with your friends in a wide variety of situations all designed to be easily completed in a single session. <br></li><li><strong>A CIV FOR ALL PLAYERS:</strong> Civilization VI provides veteran players new ways to build and tune their civilization for the greatest chance of success. New tutorial systems introduce new players to the underlying concepts so they can easily get started.</li></ul>",

        "description": "In the near future a new Exodus begins, the remnants of human civilization have to leave the perishing Earth and start traveling into the Psychosphere. The ones who call themselves the Spirits - new pastors of the human race, believe that a new planet, suitable for living, will be found in the Psychosphere. Colossal towns-arks, carrying hundreds of colonists, have been traveling for centuries through hostile worlds of Psychosphere under the guidance of Spirits. Their destination was the New Earth that was to replace their old home. All passed worlds have been connected by portals, that is how the Chain of Worlds has been created. <br><br>But the end of the hard tests is not in sight, and finally due to the despotism of Spirits and the underground intrigues Exodus went to pieces. New factions have arisen - the Empire and the Harkback. Each faction had their own goals and philosophy. The Harkbacks believed that the old Earth has not died, and the Empire - the most mysterious faction - believed that humans should stay in the Chain of Worlds. The antagonism boiled into a war that has been going on for many decades in many worlds. <br><br>Whereas the Spirits are on the way to their destination and the Harkbacks are seeking the mythical Earth, the Emperor builds up his Sponge Empire using automatic bases - his Vice Frames. He does not believe in the old or in the new Earth. <br><br>Secretly the Emperor creates the Mechanical Spirit - a super mechanism to help him discover new Worlds. Only the Emperor's mortal foes the Spirits could discover new worlds, and that was the source of their power. But now the new time has come. <br><br>One of the Vice frames starts testing this mechanism, it leads to the appearance of a super mind - Mechanical Messiah and the discovery of the parallel Chain of the Psycho-sphere Worlds. We also meet the &quot;lost&quot; Exodus Frames and find traces of the mysterious alien race. The three sides are in the middle of the deadly battle: the Scourge against the Emperor's Slaves, Lash of the Spirits against the Calling of Messiah, a dead truth against a newborn lie. <br><br>Who are the Spirits - savers or killers of the human race? Who is Messiah judge or a puppet? Who is the Emperor? Who will win? The player will find out the answer during the spectacular single player campaign in Perimeter: Emperor's Testament. <br><br>&quot;I feel hungry tension of the highest spheres. Flesh and blood of the Sponge have been set in motion; they are pulsating around the world in which the Emperor is creating a new history of the great Chain.&quot;<br><br><ul><li>Fast paced Real-Time-Strategy action<br></li><li>Construct or destroy the very gameworld environments themselves using terraforming<br></li><li>Vast singleplayer campaign expanding the story of the original Perimeter<br></li><li>New special units, buildings and soundtrack<br><ul><strong>Perimeter: Emperor's Testament is affected by the GameSpy shutdown on the 31st of May.

Excessive lay days are taboo. <br><br>55 of the largest and best known, as well as the most exotic harbors in the world await your visit; one of these is your home harbor, which you will choose yourself. Every harbor has its advantages and disadvantages, so you should carefully consider which one you choose. A highly polished bonus system will lend an element of suspense to every decision. And with 20 classes of ship available, you will have to bear a lot of factors in mind: is your new ship designed for the Panama Canal, or will you have to take a longer route? Would you rather take the shortest route through the Suez Canal, or head for the ports of Africa to land other lucrative assignments? Are you likely to encounter a storm on your chosen route, or is there currently a threat of piracy somewhere along the way? Is there even adequate space at your destination port for your newest freighter? <br><br>Painstakingly crafted harbors based on real-world models as well as realistic ships and routes make <strong>TransOcean – The Shipping Company</strong> a unique gaming experience. An elaborate trade system with dynamic prices allows you to constantly keep an eye on the most lucrative routes, as this is the only way you can secure the best jobs.

Then consider that the more successful you are and the better your reputation is, the better the offers you will receive. In online mode, you can compete with other players for the more lucrative routes and the best prices; the law of supply and demand applies in this case. Numerous paths can lead you to your goal – find the right strategy to continually expand your empire and become the most successful transport company of all time!Features<ul><li>Complex assignment management that always poses new challenges</li></ul><ul><li>55 detailed harbors, 20 of which have iconic landmarks</li></ul><ul><li>20 realistic ship classes with ships that have to be maintained</li></ul><ul><li>22 trade goods</li></ul><ul><li>Exciting chance occurrences and global events influence what happens</li></ul><ul><li>Self-guided or automated mooring and casting off</li></ul><ul><li>Online mode: other players influence routes and commodity prices</li></ul>",

        "description": "<strong>Life is Feudal: Your Own</strong> is a truly hardcore sandbox RPG with captivating survival aspects. Described as a real life Medieval simulator, which caters for up to 64 players on a 3km x 3km gameworld, any and all paths are an option. <br><br>Current version of LiF:YO DOES NOT include the free Life is Feudal:MMO ticket in it now. Please, purchase it separately here: <a>http://store.steampowered.com/app/700030/Life_is_Feudal_MMO/</a><br><br>LiF:YO places you in a realistic feudal setting with the ability to host your own private world and set your own rules to suit your playstyle. There’s an in depth crafting system, a range of building features, and free terraforming across the map - meaning you can build your own house anywhere in the world. Team up with your friends and build a village or city and repel attacks by other players who want to ransack your lands! <br><br>The unique combat system is non-target and physics-based; the direction of your attack depends on mouse movement. Basic movements and directional attacks can be combined to create deadly combos with special harmful effects. Battle formations are also a new way to collaborate and control the situation on the battlefield with your fighting team. Co-operation and a good strategy within a formation will help you prevail against the enemy.<br><br>Everything is tweakable and unique to you, including how your character progresses. The skill and stat cap system allows you to design a character molded to fit your style perfectly, for example. Even alchemy is unique; all recipes are randomized for each character thus the only way to learn is by experimentation.Features<strong>Unique Features:</strong> <br><ul><li><strong>Free Terraforming &amp; Tunnel Building.</strong> 100% free terraforming and tunnel building means you can dig tunnels, mines and moats and expand them in all dimensions barely without limit! You can raise and lower ground levels with a landfall effect. Substances include soil, rock, granite, ore veins, clay, sand, and much more <br></li><li><strong>Battle Formation System.</strong> Strategize for massive battles and provide your units with certain bonuses with the formation system. Keep organised and inside the formation shape to continue to reap the benefits<br></li><li><strong>Unique Alchemy Combinations.</strong> There are over 40,000,000 alchemy combinations unique to each player! You need to learn, experiment and create your very own unique combinations. Complementing the hardcore feel of the game, alchemy is not simply a matter of character skill as it strongly emphasises spending time and resources on creating good recipes and combinations<br></li><li><strong>Full Seasonal Weather System.</strong> Much like in real life, LiF features seasonal weather that directly affects your life in this feudal world <br></li><li><strong>Complex Food &amp; Cooking System.</strong> Cooking is no longer a secondary or non-existent skill. Being a good cook who knows many complex and tasty recipes means that you and your friends will be better fed and will receive skill bonuses <br></li><li><strong>Realistic Player Damage System.</strong> Based on human anatomy, with fractures and bleeding wounds, you can create unique and deadly combat tactics<br></li><li><strong>Double Health &amp; Stamina Bars.</strong> Double health and stamina bars represent better information about the status of your body. Players can be knocked unconscious or killed. They can also be temporarily out of breath or totally exhausted</li></ul>These are only a handful of the many features that make Life is Feudal:Your Own unique and true to life in a Medieval world.  With hundreds of personal choices and customizations on offer to create endless combinations, your imagination will be your only limitation.",

Thanks to our proprietary engine Sparta 3D we make the fourth dimension as available as the other three. Just as with a VCR you can rewind time or fast-forward through it seamlessly.<br><br>Combining this and our time line concept you will solve mind-bending puzzles, by giving yourself a helping hand. Any time you need a friend, you can be that friend. Create a new timeline at any time/any place there are no restrictions. This game is all about giving you full freedom in four dimensions.<br><br>Solve puzzles involving lasers, mirrors, force fields, trap doors, platforms, keys etc. Exploit time to do the impossible. Explore the world and see into the mind of its people. We hope that you will enjoy the result of our years of evenings and weekends.<br><br>Contains 6-14 hours of gameplay.Key Features<br><ul><li><strong>4D Gameplay </strong><br> The fourth dimension Time is as accessible to you as the other three since at any time you can rewind to any earlier point in time, to find that perfect moment for you. No more frustrating replays performing the same sequence over and over again. Just rewind and fix.<br></li><li><strong>Single Player Cooperation </strong><br>This is the key part of the game. You can exist in many parallel timelines using time clones. It means that every time you need a friend's help in the game, you can be that friend. You can spawn a new time clone at any position and time in the game, and once you create a new one it’s there forever. <br></li><li><strong>Multiple true timelines </strong><br>Time clones will continue to perform the actions you recorded. They are, however, still a part of the game world, and if you change the game world the end result will also change. <br></li><li><strong>Temporality fielded objects </strong><br>A temporality fielded object is an object that won’t be affected by your time manipulations, because it is inside a field that cancels out all timelines except the original one. <br></li><li><strong>The Paradox Effect </strong><br> Combining the true timelines with the temporality fielding allows us to create paradox based puzzles where one single timelines performs multiple different actions depending from where in time it is viewed. Mathematically every temporality fielded object increases the number of dimensions with one which is what allows the paradox effect.</li></ul>",

        "name": "Clandestine",
        "description": "Summary<br><strong>Clandestine</strong> is a 2-player or singleplayer stealth/hacking game set in 1996. Asymmetrical co-op allows one player to take the role of the spy while a friend provides overwatch and assistance as the hacker, and unravel a post-Cold War espionage conspiracy.<br><br>The year is 1996, five years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. A string of accidents and murders gone mostly unnoticed by the public eye have put the world of international espionage on high alert - veteran Cold War operatives from both sides of the former Iron Curtain are being assassinated around the globe. High-ranking officials of the CIA and the FSB secretly establish a joint task force to investigate the leaks. Codenamed The Kingbridge Executive, the group is funded with whatever money could be skimmed off of official projects and staffed by whoever could be spared from official operations. As field operative Katya Kozlova or hacker Martin Symborski, you will be deployed on dangerous missions across Europe and North America, chasing the source of the leaks.Key Features<br><ul><li><strong>Single Player &amp; Asymmetrical co-op:</strong> Play as the spy while a friend guides you through the missions or take on the role of the hacker to crack infrastructure and defeat security systems.<br></li><li><strong>A return to hard-core stealth games</strong> where the enemies are lethal and combat is unforgiving.<br></li><li><strong>A deep hacking system</strong> built around core stealth game mechanics, rife with options to manipulate the game world and mess with your enemies.<br></li><li><strong>Use social engineering in cooperative dialogue sequences</strong> to bypass security checkpoints and gain entry to restricted areas.<br></li><li><strong>Your actions won't go unnoticed</strong> - the story will respond to how much evidence you leave in each mission and how many dead bodies you leave in your wake.</li></ul>Playing as the Spy<br>The role of the <strong>Spy</strong> will be familiar to fans of stealth/action games. As the Spy, you will experience Clandestine as a 3rd person game, controlling the movements and actions of Katya in the game world. Katya is the boots on the ground, armed with weapons and gadgets that you can use to stay alive and evade your opponents. Katya is also well trained in hand-to-hand combat, and can use lethal or non-lethal stealth takedowns to take down enemies, leaving behind as little evidence as possible. During the mission, it also falls to the Spy to search for dossiers and intel to unlock new equipment and software for subsequent missions.<br><br>Playing as the Hacker<br>Martin operates in an entirely different way than the spy, which is reflected in the hacker player's interface and game mechanics. As the Hacker, players have access to four game windows and a toolbar. These game windows are: the Camera Feed, the Console, the Network View, and the Tactical Map.<br><br><strong>Camera Feed</strong><br><br>The Camera Feed allows the hacker to observe the game world and scout ahead for the Spy. By default, the Camera Feed displays the Operative Camera (a hidden camera worn by Katya), but you can also jump into surveillance cameras on the Tactical Map (see below) to look through them and scout the levels for enemies and other threats. The Camera Feed also displays the status of the Spy's health.<br><br><strong>Console</strong><br><br>The Console always displays game Objectives at the top of the window and prints important information in the Message Log such as cracked keypad codes. You can also use it to communicate with the Spy via the in-game text chat.<br><br><strong>Network View</strong><br><br>The Network View window is where Hackers can access the computer network(s) which run all of the electronic infrastructure in the mission area. This includes door keypads, PCs, Servers, Firewalls, and Hazards (steam pipes and electrical boxes which can be triggered to cause &quot;accidents&quot;). Hackers must be mindful of the Network Admin, an enemy AI which searches for changes in the Network and tries to correct them. Not only will the Admin kick a hacker from the Network if caught, the Admin will also reset firewalls and pass-codes. Hackers can unlock Viruses and DDOS attacks to keep the Admin busy when trying to escape or complete an objective.<br><br><strong>Tactical Map</strong><br><br>The Tactical Map is the window Hackers use to provide direct support to their Spy partners. This includes gaining access to cameras for scouting and observation, tagging enemies so the spy can track their location without maintaining line-of-sight, and use Local Assets to drop ammo or health, &quot;clean up&quot; bodies, cancel alarms before they sound, and even bribe enemies.",

        "description": "12/02/2015. Well am happy to say this is a true horror survival game. Some bugs to work out, but will have that resolved for the most part by the 20th. We have also uploaded the new footage of the game on here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n11/30/2015 UPDATE: WE ASK ALL REVIEWERS TO REPLAY THE GAME. THE FOOTAGE ON THE STORE PAGE IS 100 PERCENT IN ACCURATE AT THIS TIME. OVER THE NEXT 48 HOURS WE WILL BE UPDATING THE TRAILER, SCREENSHOTS AND MORE. THE GAME IS NOW A TRUE SURVIVAL HORROR GAME. WE HAVE CHANGED OUT THE MESH, CHANGED THE LEVEL DESIGN, MADE THE GAME MUCH SLOWER. WE COMPLETELY 100 PERCENT RIPPED OUT THE OLD A.I AND REPLACED IT WITH NEW A.I. THE ZOMBIES WILL NOT DAMAGE THE PLAYER AT THIS TIME BUT WITHIN A FEW DAYS THEY WILL. AGAIN THIS GAME IS NOT THE SAME IT ONCE WAS WE ARE TAKEN FULL STRIVE IN CHANGING THE PLAY MECHANICS AND WE HAVE DONE SO WITH GREAT STRIVE THE LAST 72 HOURS. THE GAME DOES NOT REFLECT AND VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE NOR DOES IT REFLECT ANY REVIEWS AT THIS CURRENT TIME UNTIL SUCH REVIEWS ARE UPDATED TO THIS DATE. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWE DO APOLOGIZE TO EVERYONE, AND WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT AND NOW ARE APPLYING WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED INTO CHANGING THIS GAME AROUND. COMMENTS HAVE ALREADY COME IN FROM YESTERDAYS BUILD WHERE SOMEONE COMMENTED THE GAME IS NOW DECENT, THAT ALONE IS A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT. TODAY WE FIXED A TON OF MORE THINGS AND ADDED QUITE A BIT. WE ASK FOR YOU HONEST FEEDBACK, SO WE CAN REALLY MAKE THIS GAME SOMETHING AND GIVE YOU ALL THAT GAME THAT YOU DESERVE AND CAN PLAY. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWE APPRECIATE EVERYONES TIME.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11/28/2015<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are under going the Remake of T.R at this time. Over the next couple of weeks you will see massive amounts of updates. We will have a new build up and running within the next 24 hours. The game has already changed drastically and for the better. You now play as a 3rd person/FPS view. We have really slowed down the game play, and really have made this a very creepy survival horror game. Gabby now plays a huge role in the game as well, and will continue to do so throughout the series. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe community has spoken, and it is a bout time we got are foot in gear and did something about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nT.R Will now offer you dark creepy areas, where only a flashlight tied to your hip and 2 of your weapons will only be able to see the light of day, in most areas. Play as Mark Forah a former scientist who created an Obelisk that could harness energy from organic objects and use that energy into the newest power source for the world! Soon after his discovery Mark was taken along with his daughter to a research faculty, where he was demanded to show them how he created the Obelisk. After his refusal, his daughter was used as a bargaining chip, which they went to far on and injected his daughter from the Obelisk harnest energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Mark wakes up in a prison with no memory of what has happened. He must quickly learn that survival is number one on the list, and find his daughter.",

        "name": "Slip",
        "description": "Slip is a fast paced side scrolling platformer that utilizes a two-color swap mechanic to allow the player to evade danger. Slip is not for the faint of heart. It has an immense focus on timing and features devilishly tricky level design. Utilizing your two colors, absorb damage from incoming projectiles of the same color, or be destroyed immediately by the opposite color. Additionally, Slip features colored Geometry that you only interact with when you share its color. This is perfect when you need a place to stand, but can result in instant death if you land on a set of spikes sharing your color. In addition to color based obstacles, Slip is also host to numerous Color driven props. Sharing the color of a launch-ring will shoot you in the direction it faces. Match the color of a gravity well to get sucked in and color swap again to have it launch you in which ever direction you are spinning. Lastly, utilize the phase shift platforms to shift vertically in the direction of your color. <br><br><strong>Game Progression: </strong><br>Slip is split up into 12 levels with an overworld connecting them. Game progression is linear with each level being unlocked when the level before it is beaten. Each level features a plethora of deadly obstacles that result in instant death. However, since the game can be quite difficult, there are frequent checkpoints laid throughout each level. Lives are NOT limited. You can press on until your thumbs are weary. <br><br>At the end of every level there is a mini-boss or boss encounter. During these sequences the game switches to an autorun mode where the player can adjust their position on screen by moving left or right. Here, positioning can mean the difference between life and death.Why we run: The story of Slip.You play as the devilishly cubie protagonist. You've always been pretty awesome with your ability to swap between 2 colors. You're a pretty sweet deal. Your nemesis Steve, on the other hand, is gross and smooth, nasty and organic. His color is that of a sickly peach. Why doesn't he just swap colors like you? Because he can't. Because he's Steve. In his early years Steve idolized you. He wanted to be you. After a failed attempt to become your sidekick (you don't have sidekicks since you're not a superhero) Steve began to seclude himself from the world. His envy of you grew and turned to hatred and resentment. He worked tirelessly in his lab creating all forms of horrible beings. His greatest triumph however has just been unleashed upon you. You couldn't have foreseen in your wildest dreams that Steve's malice would lead to such a monstrosity as the color purple. And now, it is upon you.<strong>Key Features</strong><ul><li>Steam Leaderboards: Keep track of your rank in every level of Slip. (PC only. The Mac version does not have Steamworks support)</li></ul><ul><li>Challenge Levels: In addition to the core game levels, there are also 20 challenge levels that really put your platforming skills to the test.</li></ul><ul><li>Controller Support: Enjoy Slip from the couch. (PC only. Mac versions of Slip do not have controller support)</li></ul><ul><li>Accessory Unlocks - To add a bit of silly to a light hearted game, players can also unlock clothing accessories to wear while playing.

As such, there are 3 levels of play. Normal - 100% gamespeed. Hard - 110% gamespeed. And Sassy - 120% gamespeed. These percentages might not sound intimidating, but they are really quite dramatic in the context of Slip</li></ul>",

        "name": "Evolution RTS",
        "description": "<strong>Evolution RTS</strong> is a free an Open Source RTS game designed using the Spring Engine. It has been in development for many years and receives updates often. Its gameplay is designed specifically to appeal to gamers of all skill levels. The gameplay is designed around the use of unit groups, and the mixture of your unit group often will determine how successful you are in battle, as opposed to churning out hundreds of the same unit continually.<br><br>The economy and teching system is easy to learn and use. The game itself supplies many tools that make managing your economy easier so that you can focus more on crushing your enemy than of playing simcity in your base. Units interact using realistic physics and varied terrain (you can actually micro units in order to dodge projectiles!).<br><br>Below is a very short list of the features that Evolution RTS has to offer:<br><br><strong>Realistic Physics</strong><br>Projectiles and units use a realistic physics system which allow for unprecedented control and gameplay. Micro your units to avoid projectiles. Hide behind terrain for cover.<br><br><strong>Epic and Macro scales</strong><br>Control the battlefield and a level that feels the most comfortable to you, whether zoomed in controlling individual units, zoomed out viewing the entire map and issuing orders on a macro scale, or somewhere in between! You are in complete control!<br><br><strong>Fine tuning controls for builders</strong><br>Set builders on repeat so that they repeat the orders you give infinitely until they die. Adjust builder priority in order to control the amount of resources allocated to that specific builder’s construction project.<br><br><strong>Unique Cover System allows you to easily set up ambushes</strong><br>Hide your army in rocks and foilage completely undetected and lie in wait to ambush your enemy!<br><br><strong>Gameplay geared towards casual gamers in addition to hardcore rts fans, as opposed to only being fun to play at the higher levels</strong><br>Gameplay designed around being easy to learn yet hard to master. As a newbie you can be up and running in no time, and the gameplay ensures that just because you are new, you aren’t necessarily at a huge disadvantage.<br><br><strong>Hundreds of units at once</strong><br>The Spring Engine allows for hundreds or thousands of units to be beating the daylights out of each other all at once. Gameplay scales seamlessly to fit!<br><br><strong>Unique unit abilities</strong><br>Discover units with special abilities, such as the ORB with it’s incredible area healing abilities, or the Overseer with it’s EMP ability!<br><br><strong>Simple Economy</strong><br>The economy is designed to be easy to learn, and use. There are only two resources in the game; Energy and Metal. Energy is used for utility purposes such as unit ammunition, powering shields, and building nuclear missiles, whereas metal is used to construct structures and units. Metal income is split between allies and resources that overflow the player’s capacity automatically flow into allies banks.<br><br><strong>Easy to learn teching system</strong><br>Simple teching system that revolves around using the same buildings that supply energy as a means to increase your tech availability ensure seamless transitions into heavier unit technologies.<br><br><strong>Beautiful effects</strong><br>Full particle effects engine and beautiful effects painstakingly created down to the last detail ensure that every battle will be visually stunning!<br><br><strong>Full Soundtrack</strong><br>Full in-game soundtrack that highlights the mood based upon whether you are building structures in your base or engaged in an all out no holds barred war for survival will keep you on your toes and fuel your need for dominance! Over 40+ tracks!<br><br><strong>Easy battle formations</strong><br>Easy to use battle formations via selecting a group of units, right-clicking and dragging on the map make it easy for you to give complex orders to your units,  even in the midst of a battle!<br><br><strong>Intelligent Unit Targeting AI</strong><br>Units automatically target the best enemy units to attack on their own, leaving you to concentrate on formations, flanking, and commanding your army!<br><br><strong>Give orders via the mini-map</strong><br>Full unit orders can be given via the minimap, so you can control your units intuitively no matter where your camera is pointing.<br><br><strong>Place map markers with or without labels, and draw directly on the map</strong><br>Map markers, drawing, and labels make it easy for you and your allies to communicate your battle plans, and illustrate them!<br><br><strong>Unit balance dependent on unit mixture instead of one unit owning an entire army all by itself</strong><br>Unit balance is designed so that composition matters more than simply churning out hordes of the most expensive unit.<br><br><strong>Intelligent builder AI</strong><br>Builders have a plethora of tools and options available to use to help you with macro tasks so that you can focus on kicking robotic ass!<br><br><strong>Completely customizeable GUI</strong><br>The many parts of the in-game gui can easily be moved around, resized, and positioned exactly how you like it! Be your own boss!<br><br><strong>Gorgeously detailed unit textures and designs</strong><br><br><strong>Automatic ladder ranking and replay system</strong><br><a>http://replays.springrts.com/browse/game=9</a><br><br>Completely free, forever!<br>Open Source!<br><a>http://www.source.evolutionrts.info</a><br><br><strong>Evolution RTS</strong> is a continually evolving and developing game; <strong>Come and join our community!</strong> We love having more people to talk to and play with!

I would like to thank all of you who tried and played the game, like or dislike it.  A lot of the players dislike Final Slam 2 and if you compare it to other full-blown mainstream competitive fighting games and you don't like it, well, your dislike for the game is justified and I understand.  With very limited budget and with only one person working on the game (which is myself), as opposed to bigger-sized indie or mainstream companies, I understand that I cannot provide the best graphics, gameplay and most modern features to satisfy the hardcore fighting gamer.  Therefore, I decided to make it more of a casual game and focus on the uniqueness of the game that not many fighting games have.  And this uniqueness comprises:<br><br>1. the character creation mode with speed creation settings<br>2. Final Slam Season Mode where you can win titles and fight up a league (fight with characters you created as well)<br>3. the automatically-generated AI fighters in season mode.  <br><br>Other features include the ability to export your fighter to a text string that can be saved and shared anywhere you like.  Therefore, it is possible to create an unlimited amount of characters.  Some players have had a lot of fun playing the game, but some haven't and others don't even care about what the game has to offer.  But anyway, I accept all opinions and judgment about the game and welcome you to try it out at a low cheap price.  You can request for a Steam refund if you feel it is not for you.  Thanks again.",

Alpha comes before Beta, so it's full of crawling bugs and creeping inconsistencies that we haven't had time to stomp out just yet - but you can help us do the stomping, and have some fun in the process!<br><br><strong>Alpha1.16</strong> lets you experience the beginnings of the reign of the Undead Overlord with the first five story missions, two skirmish maps, and a special alphaTest map available to those who take part in the game’s Early Access program. Play the game like you're riding a bucking bronco - ride that sucker into submission. Then participate in forum discussions on the current state of the game, have your say, and join us as we add more missions, more maps, new features, and work towards a full release.<br><br><strong>Alpha1.16a</strong>  Jan. 21, 2016 (Current Version)<br><br><strong>New</strong><br><ul><li>added sound to burning vehicle hulks<br></li><li>collision sounds for grenades</li></ul><strong>Tuning</strong><br><ul><li>Mission 05<br><li>military command tent downgraded to a small encampment of Cougar teams, to distract less from the primary mission objective<br></li><li>city center warehouses much better defended, and now feature a group of scientists that are the primary mission goal<br></li><li>lots of new props added, more random survivor groups added<br></li><li>end mission objective location arrow added, enabled after Tank goal completed<br></li><li>some groups of humans now using wander hint parents to wander about within a limited space on the map</li></li><li>Mission 04<br><li>squads around military base will now (mostly) all reinforce each other when base is attacked, making the end of m04 a bit tougher</li></li><li>improved sound of landmine explosions and grenades with new SoundData Prefab tools<br></li><li>swapped m04 + m05 blurbs in the Mission Select screen to better match the audio plays for those missions, small editorial tweaks to blurbs</li></ul><strong>Fixes</strong><br><ul><li>turrets can’t fire through walls<br></li><li>a few bad textures in m05 cleaned up<br></li><li>fixed missing landmine sounds in skirmishes<br></li><li>fixed the “rotate camera” goal in the m01 tutorial not showing a goal arrow in the scene<br></li><li>fixed burning truck behind gas station in m04 not carved out of navmesh<br></li><li>fixed alpha test menu enabled in skirmish missions by default<br></li><li>fixed no chaos earned for killing a goat</li></ul><strong>Known Bugs</strong><br><ul><li>missing collision for animated police car in m02</li></ul><br><strong>Alpha1.16</strong>  Oct. 29, 2015<br><br><strong>New</strong><br><ul><li>Mission 04 - “Night Terrors”<br></li><li>Mission 05 - “Breakthrough”<br></li><li>New human weapon - machine gun turret<br></li><li>Mission Select screen updates:<br><li>Separate sections for mission maps vs. skirmish maps<br></li><li>Updated scene graphics<br></li><li>New radio plays for new missions</li></li><li>Bonus goals - all missions (including the two new ones) now have two functional bonus goals<br></li><li>Pooling and limiting for footstep sounds - footstep sounds don’t go missing, and don’t overlap so much that they cause weird audio artifacts<br></li><li>Added Steam Cloud support<br></li><li>Better lighting for destroyed pieces of destructibles after the destruction has happened - no longer tied to the character lighting</li></ul><strong>Tuning</strong><br><ul><li>Boss upgrades cost more<br></li><li>Speed Zombie ranged attack less powerful<br></li><li>Reviewed and tuned starting and max chaos levels for all maps</li></ul><strong>Fixes</strong><br><ul><li>Possible to target the Speed Zombie bile projectile for attack<br></li><li>Mission 01 - Humans running out of bounds<br></li><li>Mission 02 - Goat bonus linked to the wrong character (female rifle unit)<br></li><li>Mission 03 - Swat reinforcements visible at edge of the map and mini map at beginning of the mission<br></li><li>Mission 03 - Speed Zombie mutation pop-up and counter-attack notice pop-up working again<br></li><li>Skirmish 01 - Military spawning out of forward base are backtracking before finding their way<br></li><li>Misc bug fixes</li></ul><br><a>Check out the forums</a> for the complete release notes.<br><br>Current Features List<strong>&gt;</strong> 5 Missions + 2 Skirmish Maps<br><strong>&gt;</strong> Mutations: 3 Boss Zombies, each with its own Special Ability<br><strong>&gt;</strong> 8 Destructible Vehicles<br><strong>&gt;</strong> 10+ Human Types<br><strong>&gt;</strong> 15+ Destructible Object Types<br><strong>&gt;</strong> 7 Human Weapon Types - Baseball Bat, Pistol, Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Grenade, Land Mines, Machine Gun Emplacement<br><strong>&gt;</strong> Bonus: alphaTest mapPlanned Features List<strong>+</strong> 4 more Missions<br><strong>+</strong> 1 more Skirmish Maps<br><strong>+</strong> new Human Weapons (Molotov Cocktail, Rocket Launcher)<br><strong>+</strong> more Human Types<br><strong>+</strong> Zombie Upgrades<br><strong>+</strong> Boss Human<br><strong>+</strong> A whole bunch of bug fixes, game tuning, and graphical improvements . . .<br><strong>+</strong> Possible stretch goals based on community feedback!<br><br>",

Elminage Gothic, previously only available in Japanese on PlayStation® Portable, now comes to PC offering a classic old school dungeon crawling experience with a dark, gothic twist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn ancient times, the Great and Dark Gods clashed in a ferocious war over Man's control of the world, bringing despair and ruin to the lives of all humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the conflict raged, the Great Gods sought to vanquish the power of the Dark Gods through the faith of humans.  In return for their faith, the Gods promised humans a world of peace and prosperity and thereby a contract between humans and the Great Gods was formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the contract, the Dark Gods could not interfere with the world of humans and were forever sealed inside their world of darkness.  The people worshiped the Great Gods in thanks for their prosperity, and the world entered an era of peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever…<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humans grew complacent and allowed their faith to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, in the far-off realm of Ishmag, King Jardin ushers in an age of peace.  Unknown to him, the dark powers have already begun reaching out in secret, planting the seeds to bring about the revival of the Dark Gods into the hearts of men.  Foul and hideous creatures are emerging from the deep, treacherous caves of Tsun-Kurn and rumours of a rising evil are creeping across the peaceful lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is up to you to arm yourself and descend into the depths of Tsun-Kurn in an attempt to put an end to the ever growing darkness and save your kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n•\tFeaturing well over 80 hours of classic dungeon crawling gameplay!<br>\r\n•\tChoose from 16 different character classes including Hunter, Thief, Summoner and Valkyrie<br>\r\n•\tBattle and defeat over 400 stunning monsters, creatures and demons!<br>\r\n•\tEmploy over 70 spell types as you descend through multiple dungeons<br>\r\n•\tCollect and arm yourself with over 600 different items<br>\r\n•\tFeaturing the classic and traditional “THAC0” battle system<br>\r\n•\tNow fully translated into English for the first time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis PC conversion also features a number of improvements over the original, including:<br>\r\n•\tHigher resolution art<br>\r\n•\tImproved user interface<br>\r\n•\t8 stunning Steam Trading Cards to collect!",

These attributes are: Strength, Agility, Dexterity, Willpower, Intelligence, and Perception<br><br>Strategy - You must manage your bases, interceptions, and squads. Territory is equal to power in the game - the more you control, the better your interceptor coverage. Also, the faster you research, the better things could be.<br><br>Tactics - Fighting on the ground against aliens and mutants for the control of territories. Once you control a territory, you can decide what type of base you want there: Research, Military, Manufacture or Biomass repulsion.<br><br>Combat - Unique combat system features all of the best elements of both turn-based and real-time combat systems. You give orders while the game is paused to avoid the frantic rush of a real time system. While in pause you can give your troops very detailed orders taking as much time as you like. Once you are finished you simply start the game and continue playing. Once the game is underway you can pause the game at any point to update or change your orders and the game will automatically pause when important events occur, so that you may modify your plans accordingly. This combat is combining the finely grained tactics of a turn-based game with the realism of a real time system.Key features:<ul><li> Randomly generated tactical missions - each playing field will be unique meaning no two games are the same<br></li><li> Intricate, rich and frightening alien setting displayed in full 3D<br></li><li> Over 100 varied mission objectives<br></li><li> 70 plus unique weapons</li></ul>",

        "description": "X-Plane 10 Global is the latest version of a simulator that has been in development continuously for almost 20 years. This latest version of X-Plane 10 brings numerous improvements and enhancements for PC, Mac and Linux virtual pilots, unleashing the power of modern systems with its 64 bit processing and multi-core support.<br><br>Designed to be the most flexible flight simulator it has a fully open structure that allows the enthusiast to change every part. With thousands of compatible add-ons there is no kind of flying craft that is not simulated and there is a whole world to explore.<br><br>Boasting a 20 year old pedigree, X-Plane utilizes Incredible cloudscapes to bring the sky to life whilst the ground depicts real-world roads, cities, towns and more to ensure the most realistic flying experience possible. The completely new rendering engine shows the world around you in high detail and with global illumination so lights behave like real lights.<br><br>The  core is a virtual wind tunnel that creates the most realistic flight modeling available on a desktop.  Equally capable of simulating every type of aircraft, the virtual pilot is able to experience the challenges of flying big airliners or tiny ultra-light aircraft. The realism of X-Plane 10 Global is proven by the fact that X-Plane is used as a certified training tool. Each aircraft flies just as it should, from the glider to the Space Shuttle!<br><br>Air Traffic Control will guide you from startup to shut-down and also controls the other aircraft around you. Those other aircraft are not robotic as they are in other simulators, but they interact with the world in the same way as your own aircraft does. They will fight the same cross winds and turbulence as you encounter, they will need more runway to stop when the weather conditions are not favorable. Just like real pilots do, you will watch their take-off to be prepared for what your take-off will be like. It’s still simulated but it gets very close to real aviation!<br><br>X-Plane 10 Global is built with the future in mind and makes full use of the hardware in your system. If you own a fast multi-core machine you will be able to simulate more aircraft around you and see more details but even with a moderate machine X-Plane 10 Global is capable of displaying a tremendous amount of objects without slowing down.Features<br><ul><li>Super accurate flight characteristics using a virtual wind tunnel<br></li><li>Includes 30 aircraft, from gliders to the Space Shuttle<br></li><li>Online flying with other virtual pilots<br></li><li>Air Traffic Control actually controls the other aircraft around you<br></li><li>Accurate terrain, roads and more<br></li><li>Global ‘Plausible World’ auto generated scenery<br></li><li>New rendering engine with innovative global lighting<br></li><li>64 Bit optimized<br></li><li>Totally flexible and extendable with thousands of existing add-ons (and many more to come)<br></li><li>Includes super-detailed scenery for Nice (LFMN), Paderborn-Lippstadt (EDLP) and Faro (LPFR)<br></li><li>printed “Quick Start Guide” included</li></ul>Default SceneryHaving installed the software via Steam you only have the main simulator as well as the Seattle region. More scenery has been divided into various free and optional DLCs. Installation of said DLCs is quite simple and is done very fast. <strong><a>-&gt; Guide</a></strong>",

        "description": "Set in a fantasy interpretation of ancient India, Unrest is an adventure RPG focused on story and choices. Play as five ordinary people who are struggling to get by in the famine-stricken city-state of Bhimra.<br><br>Brave poverty, disease, treason, political and social upheaval. Face unique burdens and gripping dilemmas as you struggle to survive in each chapter...but choices made to help one character may well make life harder for another.<br><br>In Unrest, there are no heroes of legend, there is no mystical quest, and fate has not chosen you. <br>You're on your own.Key Features<br><ul><li><strong>Diverse Characters</strong>: Play as a peasant girl faced with an arranged marriage, a priest troubled by his radical temple, a slum dweller with a dangerous past, an ambassador from a militant nation, and a mercenary captain far out of his depth - all as part of the same narrative.<br><br></li><li><strong>Reactive Storyline</strong>: Hard decisions made in one chapter have consequences in the next. A choice made as one character may well determine the fate of another.<br><br></li><li><strong>No Right Answers</strong>: There are no fail states in Unrest - if a character dies or fails in their objectives, that becomes part of the narrative. You can play in Iron Man mode to ensure there are no second chances, or save/load if you wish (not that we recommend it).<br><br></li><li><strong>Complex Conversations</strong>: Unrest's dialogues are organic, branching exchanges designed to offer an unparalleled level of control and involvement to the player. You'll always know exactly what you're saying and how you're saying it, and you'll be able to see how much the person likes, fears, or respects you as a result.<br><br></li><li><strong>Violence is Rarely the Answer</strong>: Combat in Unrest is rare and always avoidable. When faced with the possibility of death, it's up to you to decide how much you're willing to risk.<br><br></li><li><strong>Lush Art &amp; Music</strong>: Unrest's hand-drawn sprites and environments call to mind a living canvas, while the classical Indian soundtrack perfectly echoes the narrative's emotional core.<br><br></li><li><strong>Mod Support</strong>: Create and share your own worlds and adventures.</li></ul>Notable MentionsUnrest is a game that makes me think of Bede, of transience and loss...Unrest captures something of the lives of people rather than the bombast of heroes and protagonists. <br>- <a>Rock Paper Shotgun</a><br><br>One of <a>Time Magazine</a>‘s games to watch for summer 2014<br><br>Pyrodactyl’s promises of deep interactivity and role playing freedom have, in fact, been fulfilled - <a>The Cloud Monster</a><br><br>[Unrest] tells the kind of story that very few games are willing (or able) to tell... - <a>New World Notes</a><br><br>…seems really cool.

        "name": "I Shall Remain",
        "description": "An Action RPG at its core, I Shall Remain combines role-playing elements with survival and strategic aspects, and creates a blend never before seen. Through complex, real-time character progression and RPG system, over a hundred abilities to learn and upgrade, dozens of weapons and enhancers, thousands of Infected, over twenty mutations, tens of NPCs and teammates, within a twenty-plus hour long story campaign, ISR offers plenty for everybody. <br><br>I Shall Remain is a Post Apocalyptic Action Role-Playing game with survival aspects. Set in an alternate history at the end of the Second World War, when Nazis managed to release a deadly virus over US territory, the game tells the story of two brothers and their intricate relation with the apocalyptic world that emerges in the wake of the disastrous Z0M81 pandemic.<br><br>Discover the truth about the infection and decide the future of the human race. Experience the story-driven, immersive gameplay enhanced by a dynamic real-time day-night system and the mood affecting weather system. You get to share your journey with as many as 7 other AI controlled teammates, each with their own story to tell, encounter multiple NPCs, traders and trainers and thousands Infected that you'll have to battle using over 30 weapons, from baseball bats to automatic machine guns and flame throwers and, from time to time, even tanks.<br><br><strong>Weapons</strong> - The weapons in I Shall Remain are grouped in categories. We have melee weapons (knives, baseball bats, planks, crowbars), small weapons (pistols, submachie guns), rifles (shotguns, different kinds of rifles) and heavy ones (heavy machine guns, flamethrower, bazooka). The total number of weapons is over 30 with each weapon having at least 4 levels of configuration each level giving you different effects the weapon can have over the enemies and yourself when used or equipped. Ammo can as well be imbued with serum for additional damage.<br><br><strong>Throwables</strong> - Aside weapons the player can throw grenades and plant mines for infected to step on and explode.<br><br><strong>Pickables and explosives</strong> - The player can also pickup certain objects like barrels, crates and even other NPCs to carry and help. Some of the objects while not necessarily pick-able (some barrels are both packable and explosive) can be shot and they will explode allowing you to kill lots of infected without using resources. while others can be used to barricade yourself in small confined spaces.<br><br><strong>Controllables</strong> - From time to time the game offers the player the possibility to enter tanks or other vehicles and use their weapons to defend himself or a larger area. Is up to the player to decide whether to use them or not and for how long.<br><br><strong>Buildings</strong> - Many unique buildings throughout the city to explore, each you can use differently, find cover in or loot. There's a level of risk associated with entering an unknown building as well so you should be careful when doing so.<br><br><strong>Character progression</strong> - In I Shall Remain the player gains experience as a result of taking actions. Each action in game, whether is shooting a monster, repairing a weapon or simply running will award the player with experience points in attributes and skills. The way you play the game will define what kind of character you are.<br><br><strong>Doctrines</strong> - In I Shall Remain doctrines enable your character to improve your attributes and skills or give you new abilities. Each doctrine could be upgraded each upgrade increasing doctrine’s effects or even add new ones. Currently there are up to 128 doctrines in the game.<br><br><strong>Economy</strong> - Serum is the center pylon of the game economy system and the exchange currency. Within the game there are various traders that you can interact with by selling or buying items such as weapons, doctrines, medical kits, water, ammunition, scraps, ammo and lantern batteries. Certain traders will also offer you special kind of services (buy ammo, increase your skills level or advance skill ranks).<br><br><strong>Quests</strong> - Like mostly everything in I Shall Remain, quests tend to resemble real-life scenarios thus everything is in to serve the purpose of the world and the story. That being said, most quests in I Shall Remain are story related but perhaps as much as 50% don’t relate to the main story branch. That's why, defining detailed side quests and stories became an important tool for us to allow the player to immerse himself into the game world and make it more believable.<br><br><strong>Dialogs</strong> - The Discussion/dialog system in I Shall Remain is fully dependent on your choice thus drastically shaping the way your experience develops. Whole side story branches might never be touched if the player chooses not to.<br><br><strong>Infection</strong> - The Virus is actually the main villain in the game. Everything happens because of it and you will have to deal with it on a daily basis. You cannot cure it but you can always reduce it so it won’t affect your skills and your character performance. For that not to happen though, you will always need to have a steady flow of Serum.<br><br><strong>Tiredness</strong> - Tiredness determines how much fatigue your character gathered, increased levels of tiredness affecting your health and stamina regeneration rate as well as your chances of aiming correctly. Make sure you always take time to regularly rest inside a building out of any outside influence the weather being the main factor for it.<br><br><strong>Scavenging</strong> - Throughout the game there are hundreds of places you can scavenge for resources, you just have to find those places and take the time to actually run the scavenge operation.<br><br><strong>Repairing</strong> - Every weapon in the game has a wearing off factor which determines how much you can actually use it until it breaks. There’s multiple ways of repairing your weapon, from doing it yourself using scraps or breaking other weapons to having a teammate do it for you or just get it to an NPC somewhere in the city to repair it.<br><br><strong>Teaming up</strong> - There are as many as 7 special Teammates you can take with you in your journey. Playing alone is always fun and rewarding but playing with teammates will give you a different experience altogether. Manage them, give them weapons, increase their stats and choose their path. Is all up to you on what kind of team you will lead.<br><br><strong>Senses</strong> - There's a certain threshold under which each infected type will not sense you. Walking will make you silent, using melee weapons instead of shooting ones will do it as well.<br><br>",

        "description": "<strong>Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn</strong> is a first person hunting simulator where you hunt the largest and most dangerous creatures to ever exist – DINOSAURS. <br><br>This game is a sequel of the original classic dinosaur hunting video game, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter. It’s an authentic hunting simulation where you track and stalk your prey. Careful and thoughtful consideration must be taken during the hunt; to survive you'll need to know your preys temperament and mannerisms, and just like in real hunting, you need to be aware of your surroundings (you don't want to be caught upwind of a T-Rex or you'll end being lunch). Remember you're not hunting deer, you're hunting dinosaurs.<br><br>You’ll visit huge, beautifully rendered and realistic 3D environments, each with their own unique Eco systems. There are pristine beaches, dense jungles, pine forests, muddy marshes, rocky plains and deserts to explore. Environments can be used to increase the odds of a successful hunt. Players can follow trails and track animal footprints. Awareness of wind direction is important since some dinosaurs can smell you. Using stealth and land elevation will give you a sound advantage over some of the more vicious dinosaurs. <br><br>Choose between a high caliber rifle, sniper rifle, a silent crossbow or tranquilizer gun, which puts your prey to sleep instead of killing it. You can also carry sidearms. Some of your equipment includes a handheld Gadget, which includes radar and GPS satellite positioning to make tracking the beasts easier, Cover Scent which masks your smell and numerous other goodies, which will prove indispensable for your hunting adventure.<br>There is a wide variety of different dinosaurs to hunt each with unique behaviors and intelligence. Every dinosaur in Carnivores has realistic, advanced AI logic, so from species to species , each will react differently to you. Some dinosaurs will flee if they see you, while others will become enraged and attack. During your adventure you'll experience everything from &quot;pea-brained&quot; dummies to cunning dinosaurs, with heightened senses of sight, hearing and smell. So be careful and stalk your prey intelligently, otherwise you might be the one being hunted.<strong>key Features:</strong><br><ul><li>\tHunt the largest and most ferocious animals known to man – the Dinosaurs!<br></li><li>\tHuge 3D Free-Roaming Open worlds.<br></li><li>\tBeautiful and realistic high definition graphics.<br></li><li>\tA multitude of different Dinosaurs, from Herbivorous (plant eating) to the Carnivorous (meat Eating).<br></li><li>\tRealistic AI – Dinosaurs react to sight, sound and smell, each with their own mannerisms and Behaviors.<br></li><li>\tExplore and hunt in different Eco-systems including jungles, forests, beaches and rolling Hills.<br></li><li>\tEquip camouflage and Cover Scent to even the odds.<br></li><li>\tA variety of weapons and equipment to choose from (from Sniper Rifle to Cross-bow).<br></li><li>\tMap and Radar to locate and track Dinosaurs.<br></li><li>\tUse tranquilizer darts instead of bullets (experience the thrill of the hunt without the killing).<br></li><li>\tInteractive Dinosaur Trophy Room.</li></ul>",

        "description": "Arson &amp; Plunder is a 2D arcade/beat'em up adventure based on the genre classics of the 90's. The classic gameplay has been brought up to speed with the latest developments and trends! In typical beat'em up style, playing an orc or elf you wade through hordes of enemies out to kill you in &quot;Story mode&quot;. You can also build your up-to-4 battle squad to crash them all with your friends in co-op mode. <br><br> The game features beautiful 2D visuals, interactive scenarios and a humorous story. Your objective in Arson &amp; Plunder is to survive over 25 different missions in five difficulty levels in &quot;Story mode&quot;. While playing you can always switch between being an orc or an elf. This element make the game especially dynamic. The controls are always intuitive and help you to carve your way through an adventure bursting with humor and action. &quot;Co-op mode&quot; will allow you to enjoy all the bizarre situations with your friends. Besides, you can test your endurance in &quot;Endless mode&quot; within a dedicated dungeon scenario, fighting against an increasing cornucopia of enemies!<br><br><strong>Storyline</strong><br><br>The orcs and elves of the Loidar wood have been in war since time immemorial. But their<br>struggles have been forced to a stop because of a new and powerful enemy: Man, a wicked race that wants to take possession of their sacred woodlands in order to exploit all their natural resources. In view of this threat, elves and orcs are forced to agree to a truce and to try stopping the invading forces.<br><br>They draw up a plan to stop humans and their deforestation: to find the stationed troops<br>near wood's region and to beat down their captain. But the region is protected with a magic shield that can't be destroyed by brute force. The only way to get in is to use the Milius stone, a magic stone placed in a cave near the outskirt of the forest, that will transport whoever that touches it to another cave placed near the human region.<br><br>This isn't the only problem; orcs and elves agreed to a truce, but they don't rely on the others' abilities for completing the mission successfully. So they decide to send, on their own, a warrior of each race. Elves send Tinargey (Eternal Fire Star) Arson, a graceful and skillful elf woman, well versed in the ancient secret art of Fire Mastery. Orcs sent Vrok Plunder, a rough berserker armed with a big battle axe, as lethal as his arms, legs, jaws and big hard head.<br><br>Both warriors get into the cave from two different places, and quickly progress to the magic stone, reaching it at the same time. The stone teleports them to the destination cave, but the result is not as expected: the magic travel wasn't prepared for two beings at the same time, and now the man and the fly the orc and the elf woman are fused.<br><br>So, now there is a single body inhabited by two beings, that learns summoning the body of one another as they need.<br><br>Once they get used to their new body, they get into the enemy lands, going through a near<br>deforested wood followed by a village, finding tougher new enemies. After that, they'll go toward the mountains to destroy the sorcerer that shielded their people out of the human territories. Finally, orcs and elves will help our heroes to occupy the castle and finish off the human captain in the highest tower of the palace.<br><br>At the end, the wood is safe again, and orcs and elves can continue happily with their bloody wars, but Arson &amp; Plunder™ are still trapped in the same body, and there's no magic powerful enough in the forest able to undo the spell. So, our heroes must leave to a new mission towards the unnamed lands, where it's said that most powerful wizards lives in.<br><br><strong>FEATURES:</strong><br>o             Switch your character any time you like in story mode<br>o             2D comic art style<br>o             5 difficulty levels<br>o             Over 25 missions in story mode<br>o             Challenging boss fights",

These components are naturally strung together by the game’s goals, made to be user-friendly and intuitive to use. A multitude of tutorial missions and descriptive texts help car novices become experts. Almost infinite options give the player all the creative freedom to create unique cars with vastly different engines. <br><br>Automation also features an in-game exporter which allows you to export and drive your vehicles in BeamNG.drive. The exporter is simple to use: design your car and engine in Automation, tune them to your liking, hit the export button, start up BeamNG.drive and your new car is right there in the vehicle list, with the aesthetics as well as many of the fine engineering and performance details of your car design simulated accurately<strong>KEY PLANNED FEATURES FOR THE COMPLETED GAME: </strong><ul><li>Extremely Deep, Technical, Creative – Experience unheard-of creative freedom in a highly technical, realistic gameplay experience revolving around building a car company from scratch.

More than spice travels your roads – musket armies, philosophies, and power plays that span the globe are at your control.

He knows what forces influence the prices, what events affect them. A good merchant listens to rumours and gossips spread by travelers at inns and taverns; hoping for a clue, a hint where to go, where a good deal awaits. A good merchant surrounds himself with specialists smarter than him, people who help him maximize profits and minimize losses. He always expands his fleet of carts, he balances risks, calculates profitability. <br><br>The conditions are constantly changing, and supply and demand for different goods with them. Maybe you'd like to pay a cheaper price for furs in the summer, and sell them for a hefty profit as the winter is coming and people need warmth.<br>But is it worth carrying them for so many days, risking robbery, moths and taking precious space that you could use to transport something now and make a profit immediately?<br>Or is it worth to buy illegal herb in the out of reach swamps where it cost's next to nothing, and risk smuggling it into the city where you can sell it for an amazing profit? But what if the city guards want to control you? Should you pay a bribe? How big? Maybe the best course of action is to  say that you have nothing and hope they don't find anything?<br><br>These are the types of questions you will have to ask yourself constantly. <br><ul><li>Merchants of Kaidan has 4 story lines each with many quests. Main quest that brings you closer to avenging your father's murder, and 3 side-quest lines. A total of over 100 quests each composed of multiple steps. <br></li><li>A set of random events that influence your journeys. A storm on the sea, attack by dragons, highway robbery and many, many more.<br></li><li>Three types of transport of your goods: by roads, by sea and by flight, each has its advantages and disadvantages and a unique set of events associated.

Their council will help you in a variety of issues. Some will show you shortcuts on the roads, some will help you fight of the bandits, some will council you on how to sail better and in case of a storm, how to minimize risks and losses. If you wish, you can also send them to school to improve their abilities for additional cost.<br></li><li>4 seasons of the year that influence the prices of goods, open some paths for travel and block the others.

Your father has been preparing you, for all these years, for this exact moment. Your 21st birthday.<br><br>You were finally a grown-up, able to take care of yourself, a person worthy of continuing your fathers' legacy. <br><br>He wasn't born into money. To buy his first cart, he had to work very hard saving every silver and copper. One trade after trade, step after step, he climbed the ladder, transforming his tiny one-man venture into a trading company of a rather significant size. <br><br>Then he met Van Talodd, the most famous merchant in the whole kingdom, and soon enough he entered into partnership. This enterprise proved very profitable, and Van Talodd promised your father something more precious than wealth. A lordship. Few weeks ago he left to the Capital – Ovoros – to accept the title. He was taking a little longer to come back than you expected, but recent weather was unfavourable, maybe he got stuck, or a road turned into a swamp... it happened all the time.<br><br>It was almost dusk when you heard the knocking to the door. A messenger, his clothes soiled with mud, brought you a letter. There was no lordship, your father was found a traitor, an enemy of the Kingdom, and hanged for conspiring against the king, after a very hasty trial. All his assets and estate confiscated and handed over to the person who exposed the entire plot – Van Talodd. <br><br>Suddenly everything became crystal clear, Van Talodd maimed him with promises of lordship, the only thing money can't buy. But his real purpose was to entrap your father and take over his fortune. <br><br>Instead of your birthday present, you got carts full of kings' sell-swords approaching quickly. There was no time to loose, you had to run fast and far. Flee from the men that were certainly sent to kill you. <br><br>That is only a beginning of your story, you're left with only your family ring that you had on you.  Take a fake name you need to avenge your father. Follow the same path as him, grow rich and destroy Van Talodd. The road there is hard and long – are you strong enough to make it? <br><br>Kaidan is a fictitious world, that was once a home to a space-faring civilization. It's history is almost unknown. Only that, once they developed starships, they relatively quickly left the planet. And on the remnants of the old civilization a new one has sprouted. A far less developed. If not for the artifacts left by the predecessors, they would be no different than a medieval country.",

It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the <strong>AI Storyteller</strong>. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.<br><br><strong>Your colonists are not professional settlers</strong> – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.<br><br><strong>Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play.</strong> A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.<br><br><strong>Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.</strong> Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.<br><br><strong>The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.</strong> You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.<br><br><strong>Travel across the planet.</strong> You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.<br><br><strong>You can tame and train animals.</strong> Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.<br><br><strong>People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.</strong> They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.<br><br><strong>Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.</strong> Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.<br><br><strong>You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.</strong> A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.<br><br>And there's much more than that!

To survive in a brutal, oxygen-obsessed ecosystem, you must help it see the patterns and hidden truths that make up the rules of the forest - horrible as they may be.<br><br>They Breathe is a critically acclaimed indie gem risen from the depths of Xbox Live Indie Games. In thirty short minutes, the game leaves it up to you to figure out every part of its increasingly bizarre universe, in order to survive the onslaught of unexpected creatures and ultimately comprehend their true nature. No matter how your descent to the bottom of the forest takes shape, it is guaranteed to give you the chills without a single word of dialog. <br><br>Keep your eyes open, for there is darkness beneath the surface.

Stay alert and quiet to avoid attracting them, and be prepared to either run or fight for your life at a moment’s notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRAFT - Gathering raw materials is a key part of crafting. Axes, pickaxes, and crowbars allow you to harvest the various trees, rocks, and vehicles scattered around the world. You should collect what you can, when you’re not actively fending off threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTAKE BACK CONTROL - The first step in re-establishing society is to solidify a foothold in the struggle against the undead, and you can help by building a Stronghold in Badwater Canyon. Each location has unique advantages, so it’s wise to scout before making a commitment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCOORDINATE - Those that want to travel safely, access contested locations, and successfully defend their Strongholds will want to work together with other players. Note that Badwater Canyon is a desperate place, and your neighbors may find that they’re better off just taking what they need from your dead body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you have what it takes to Just Survive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisit the Just Survive website https://www.justsurvive.com to learn more about this game.",

        "description": "<strong>WARNING:</strong> NeonXSZ is a <strong>mouse-look</strong> twitch shooter with instant turning. If you are looking for a game to use with your joystick or gamepad you will be horribly disappointed; it's not that game. It was designed from the ground up to push the speed and precision limits offered by mouse and keyboard.<br><br>When Flynn was first sucked into the totally unfamiliar alien landscape of Tron, his world and everything he knew was turned upside down. Nothing made sense for him anymore. The rules of life had changed. He had no idea how anything worked, how he would survive, or how he might escape. Welcome to our take on that concept, NeonXSZ.<br><br>In NeonXSZ, even normal gaming conventions and rules break down. This new world is initially bewildering, cruel and unforgiving. If you expect it to hold your hand through a tutorial and then spoon feed appropriately leveled enemies in your direction then you are in for a harsh awakening. There's nobody to tell you what to do here - nobody to guide you - and the moment you try to fall back on what you've learned while playing other games you will die.<br><br>We wanted to bring gamers a totally fresh gaming experience and move far away from traditional game mechanics. To survive, you will need to be smart, stay alert, play safe, and explore this strange new frontier in order to understand and uncover it's depth, mysteries and secrets. <br><br>You are a glitch in the system; an anomaly. If you have any hope of escape you will need to blend in and gain power. Eventually, if you have what it takes, you will journey deep into the very heart of the machine and ultimately meet the Gatekeeper. If you can defeat his challenges you might even escape, but we doubt it. Nobody has ever escaped. (Addendum: The legendary 'swstar' was the first and only known user to escape.)<br><br>What is it like to play?<br>The core gameplay revolves around zero-gravity, high-speed, spaceship dogfighting. Think jet fighters with the ability to turn on a dime and strafe in all directions. Dig deep enough, and you'll be able to create anything from blisteringly fast fighters to slow, heavy, tank like destroyers and specialize them with hundreds of lootable upgrades.<br><br>You might choose to dominate the open-world or progress through dozens of ever more challenging arenas. Either way, it will be a personal journey of experimentation and discovery. <br><br>FEATURES:<br>NeonXSZ features 100+ hours of gameplay and content set within a completely open-world populated with nearly one thousand persistent enemies from four warring factions, each with unique procedurally generated artificial intelligence and skill. <br><br>Loot, buy and sell hundreds of upgrades and gadgets and use them to specialize dozens of ships to suit your preferred play-style.<br><br>Test your strength in dozens of hand crafted Challenge Arenas with remarkably agile, physics-based, ship controls and combat.<br><br><ul><li><strong>Highly customizable:</strong><br>\tManually tweak everything from enemy intelligence, skill, and damage through to the look of your ship and even the look of the world around you. <br>\tSlow everything down with a game-speed slider that allows players of every skill level to enjoy the game. It's like permanent bullet time for those that need it.  </li></ul><br><ul><li><strong>Real Loot:</strong><br>\tKill a hostile and it will drop parts for every piece of equipment it has installed, not random loot. This means that defeating a higher level enemy guarantees it will drop higher level predictable loot.<br><br>If you see it, you can loot it, fly it, and use it.  </li></ul> <br>",

        "description": "Brigade E5: New Jagged Union is a tactical game that places gamers in the small tropical nation of Palinero on the verge of a civil war. The mission: hire a band of mercenaries and take control of the deteriorating situation before the country finds itself in complete ruin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story offers players an opportunity to experience three different viewpoints of the conflict or work out the political structure to achieve their own goals in the global domination. Game play for the title is based on an innovative combat system called SPMÂ® (Smart Pause Mode) that successfully blends together real-time and turn-based games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike standard turn-based systems, Brigade E5: New Jagged Union does not use &quot;action points&quot; while in turn-based mode, but takes into consideration the character skills and attributes resulting in more natural and diverse behavior of units. Furthermore players can issue a chain of commands that will be carried out automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice of weapons will satisfy even highly demanding fans, with more than 100 accurately modeled firearms, varied ammunition types, grenades, body armor and special equipment. Players will be also able to modify and upgrade weapons by adding various gadgets, sniper scopes, mini grenade launchers, bayonets, etc. The game provides extensive LAN and Internet Multiplayer modes, with CTF, Deathmatch and Fortress dynamic gameplay. SPM® is a brand new feature for the squad combat strategy genre. It gives all players a chance to command their soldiers at the same time, using even an enemy's pause.",

Mount Your Friends is a fiercely competitive sporting event for you to play with your friends in the contextual security of your own home, assuming that your home is not composed of sexual innuendo. If it is, we may suggest buying a new home or at least getting the current one cleaned professionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMount Your Friends is a physics based competitive climbing game where what you climb is each other. Players take turns climbing to the top of a tower of previous climbers (and a goat) working to become the new highest point before time runs out. If you run out of time before reaching the top, you're eliminated. It's simple to get into, but difficulty to master. Adept competitors can create massive towers by flinging themselves faster than simple climbing methods can attain. Of course, you may also end up just falling all the way down a tower if you miss!",

Attempt to escape from an environment that is out to kill you while evading the lurking terror that could be around any corner. Can you survive Monstrum? <br><br><strong>Game Features</strong><br><br>Three Unique Monsters<br><br>Face one of three monster types each play-through, each one with different behaviours and tactics. Can you work your way out of an ambush or escape a direct attack?

Hide in lockers or under furniture. Use distractions to attract the monster to you, or, perhaps more wisely, to where you've just been, but be careful not to run too fast lest you fall into one of the ships numerous traps along the way. <br><br>Permadeath<br><br>Death is death. Get killed in Monstrum and you'll be starting again. In a different ship, probably against a different monster. Good luck. Start running.",

He plugs in the cartridge right away, and get sucked into a vivid, but decaying world of platforming.

I am curious to see who will prevail.&quot;<br><br><strong>Ascendant</strong> is the unforgiving beat 'em up that challenges you with a new world each time you play. It utilizes a number of modern roguelike elements such as permadeath and procedurally generated environments. You are a demigod who invades a plane controlled by your rivals. They will stop at nothing to eliminate you. Only the most impressive warriors will triumph over their armies of zealots and beasts.<br><br>By exploring the world, discovering new weapons, spells, and Blessings, and learning how to survive in this brutal realm, you may have a small chance at winning.Features<ul><li><strong>A Brutal Struggle</strong> – The armies of your demigod rivals are relentless. When a foe cuts you with his sword, it hurts. If you slip into a pit of spikes, the blades leave deep wounds. If a bomb explodes nearby you will burn. Health recovery items are rare. Fight with precision, speed, and timing to survive. Dodge attacks and crush your opponent when he is off-balance to seize the advantage. <br><br></li><li><strong>Loot the Treasures of the Gods</strong> – The gods hid their ancient relics in secret caches scattered around the world. Discover unique weapons, spells, and Blessings that grant mighty powers. Double jump, choke your enemies with a poison cloud, or jolt them to ashes with lightning. Equip and customize your Blessings to determine your own fate. <br><br></li><li><strong>Agile Beat 'em Up Combat</strong> – Slam enemies into each other to deal massive damage. Pummel enemies with ground and air combos or launch a barrage of spells. Launch your opponents in the air with rapid dashing assaults making them helpless against your divine onslaught.<br><br></li><li><strong>Death is Final</strong> – When your enemies defeat you, the game is over. No respawning. No returning to the last save point. You will need all your cunning and skill to win. <br><br></li><li><strong>A New World Each Run</strong> – Each playthrough creates a new hazardous land for adventure. You will never know exactly what you will encounter in the next room, which hazards will be presented to you, what you will find in a chest, or even (in some cases) which boss you will be fighting next. Expect hours of replayability and new challenges.  </li></ul><strong>...And More</strong><ul><li>Two is better than one. Conquer the world with another demigod using <strong>local co-op</strong><br></li><li><strong>Unlock new characters</strong> with distinct stats attuned for any playstyle<br></li><li><strong>Enhance your weaponry</strong> to adapt and overcome the enemy swarm   <br></li><li><strong>Special events</strong> make each run fresh and memorable</li></ul>",

As a lowly cleaning robot, your task is to gather precious materials from each world before the solar system goes kaboom. As soon as you land, you realize this gig isn't going to be as simple as you had hoped. During the day you'll scramble to gather resources, build structures and keep your base in good repair. But when it gets dark, get ready to fight. Those rampaging wild robots aren't here to have a knitting competition.<br><br>At least you're not alone in your daily chores. Fleshy, unintelligent and very unattractive human creatures live on these planets. You've discovered they're quite amenable to being told what to do, even if those tasks are as limited as carrying resources back and forth. Mix some DNA from a few different species, however, and you can breed humans with special powers. Like, say... laser beam eyes! A little mod here, a little hack there and they might turn out to be quite useful!Features<br><ul><li> <strong>Fuse alien and human DNA:</strong> Create hybrids with special alien abilities by mixing DNA from two different meatbags. A human is useful, but a human with a laser eyes, and a new pair of arms is even more useful.<br></li><li> <strong>Build offensive and defensive structures:</strong> Hold back the wild robot hordes while simultaneously pummeling them with lasers, missiles, bolts of electricity and your very own personal attack drones. 15 unique structures to create and upgrade.<br><br></li><li> <strong>Enhance your base with technology: </strong>Influence the battlefield and manage your base with nine different pieces of buildable technology. Need to heal yourself? There's tech for that. Want to build drones? Tech for that, too!<br></li><li> <strong>Motivate your meatbags: </strong>The humans usually do what you ask. Unless they're tired or bored or just plain apathetic. Fortunately there's plenty of alien biotechnology you can implant to give them a little encouragement.<br><br></li><li> <strong>Robotic enemies:</strong> Nobody knows where the wild robots come from, but they sure are well-armed. Eight unique enemy types that range from creepy crawly things to dashy explodey things.<br></li><li> <strong>Boss robots: </strong>Three sinister bad guys to take out with your turrets. One of them has a giant brain.
